Most noun phrases contain only one determiner or none at all, but if there are more, they follow a definite order. 

Based on their position in a noun phrase, determiners are of three type:

Pre-determiner + Central Determiner + Post-determiner

## Central determiners

* Articles (a/an, the), 
* Demonstratives (this, these, that, those)
* Possessives (my, your, her, his, x’s etc).

A noun phrase will normally contain only one central determiner.

Few Exceptions: Possessive case of noun, i.e. x’s <br>
I spoiled my <b>mother's</b> rug.

Central determiners can be used in combination with pre-determiners and post-determiners.

## Pre-determiners

The predeterminers occur prior to other determiners. 

The class of words that are more likely to work as pre-determiners are:

###  Multipliers 

That is, double, twice, four/five times . . . .

This bus holds <b>three times</b> the passengers as that mini-van.

I hope my boss will <b>double</b> my salary.

### Fractional expressions 

That is, half, one-third, three-quarters, etc.

<b>Half</b> the students came from overseas.

John finished the lesson in <b>one-fourth</b> of the assigned time.

<b>Two-fifths</b> of the respondents reported that Javascript is the best programming language.

###  Distributives 

That is, no, either, neither, each, both and all

<b>Both</b> my young sisters are really naughty.

<b>All</b> the visitors left the ship.

<b>Either</b> of these two students can win the trophy.

### Some Quantifiers 

That is, some, any, enough

<b>Some</b> two hundred people gathered in the pouring rain.

We have lost <b>enough</b> of our soldiers.

### Interrogatives 

That is, what, which 

<b>What</b> a shot!

<b>Which</b> of your shirt is missing?

### Another

I want <b>another</b> two glasses of milk.

<hr>

* Some pre-determiners may follow the following structure:

Pre-determiner + of + Central determiner

<b>All</b> of the visitors left the party.

<b>Half</b> of the apples will have to be thrown away.

I want to have <b>some</b> of those oranges.

<b>Neither</b> of my sisters is married.

## Post-determiners

Post-determiners are determiners that occur after another determiner in a noun phrase. 

The class of words that are more likely to work as post-determiners are:

### Ordinal numbers 

That is, first, second, third, etc and the words next, last etc.

This is my <b>first</b> drink. 

The <b>next</b> round is going to be very exciting.

### Cardinal numbers 

That is, one, two, six, etc.

I lost those <b>two</b> books.

The <b>three</b> men just arrived.

### A Caveat!

Some words can do multiple roles, i.e. they can be pre-determiners, as well as post-determiners.

Many: <br>
<b>Many</b> a man has tried but few men have succeeded.<br>
The <b>many</b> kind things she did went unnoticed.

Several:<br>
They have blocked <b>several</b> of their accounts.<br>
Soon world will know about our <b>several</b> achievements.
