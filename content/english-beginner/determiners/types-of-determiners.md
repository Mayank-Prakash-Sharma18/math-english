Determiners have two main functions: 

* Referring nouns - They make the reference of nouns more specific or general 

* Quantifying nouns

## Referring Determiners

Referring means showing us who or what the noun is pointing to or talking about. 

They tell the reader or listener whether we're referring to a specific or general thing. 

* General determiners - used when we are talking about people or things in an indefinite way.

* Specific determiners - used when we are talking about specific people or things.

The most common types of determiners which we use for referring are articles, demonstratives and possessives.

### Articles

That is, a/an, the

* INDEFINITE ARTICLES (a, an) - They are General determiners, because general version of noun is referred to.

<b>A</b> man came into the shop.

<b>An</b> honest person would not cheat.

* DEFINITE ARTICLES (the) - It is a Specific determiner, because specific noun is referred to.

<b>The</b> cop chased <b>the</b> thugs.

### Demonstratives 

That is, Demonstrative Pronouns: this, that, these, those

They are Specific determiners. They are used to point some specific noun within a sentence. 

They specify the distance of something in space or time in relation to the speaker. 

This & These - for close by nouns (in space or time)
That & Those - for nouns that are further away (in space or time)

<b>This</b> car is better than <b>that</b> one.

<b>These</b> grapes are greener than <b>those</b> ones.

<b>This</b> summer is the warmest I can remember.

### Possessives

These are Specific determiners. These are words that are used to show <strong>specific</strong> ownership (of noun) 

* Possessive determiners: my, your, his, her, its, your, our, their

I gave <b>my</b> bike to <b>her</b> brother.

Possessive determiners, which go with a noun / noun phrase, are not the same as Possessive pronouns (e.g. mine, hers, ours, yours, theirs etc.), which can stand alone. 

This is <b>my</b> pen. (possessive determiner) <br>
This pen is <b>mine</b>. (possessive pronoun)

* Possessive case of nouns: x’s (possessive ’s)

<b>Mragank’s</b> new job is awesome.

They may itself include one of the other determiners.

I spoiled ***my mother's*** rug. (here mother's has been used with another determiner 'my')

### Interrogatives

That is, which, whose and what

* Which and whose are <strong>specific</strong> determiners. 

Here are the books you ordered. <b>Which</b> book do you think is the most interesting?

<b>Which</b> library did you go to?

<b>Whose</b> book is that? 

* What is a <strong>general</strong> determiner

<b>What</b> food do you like?

I don’t know <b>what</b> job she does.

## Quantifying Determiners

‘Quantifying’ means showing how much of something there is, or how many.

The most common types of determiners which we use for quantifying are Quantifiers, Numbers and Distributives.

### Quantifiers

That is, (a) few, fewer, (a) little, many, much, more, most, some, any, a lot of etc.

They indicate how much or how little of the noun is being discussed.

I’ve got <b>some</b> milk but I haven’t got <b>any</b> tea.

Only <b>a few</b> experts know the answer to that.

Selecting the correct quantifier depends on your understanding the distinction between Countable and Non-Countable Nouns. 

### Numbers

cardinal (one, two, three…), and ordinal (first, second, third…)

<b>Four</b> rebels were found hiding in the basement.

Nadal lost in the <b>second</b> round of the French open.

Grammatically speaking, the words next, last, another, previous, subsequent, can also be regarded as ordinal numbers. (some call them General ordinals)

It rained on the <b>last</b> day of our holiday.

The <b>next</b> house is the one where Mr. Antonio lives.

I want <b>another</b> glass of milk.

### Distributives 

That is, all, both, no, half, either, neither, each, every

<b>Each</b> child was vaccinated.

<b>Every</b> troop was given a helmet to wear.
