## Position of Subject

The Subject of a sentence usually comes first, but occasionally it is put after the Predicate:

Here comes <b>the bus</b>. (What comes? - the bus) <br>
Sweet are <b>the uses of adversity</b>. (What are sweet? - the uses of adversity) <br>
Under no circumstances, can <b>I</b> help you. (Subject - I) <br>
Have <b>you</b> eaten breakfast? (Subject - you)

## Dummy Subjects

English sentences which are not imperatives must have a subject. 

Sometimes we need to use a ‘dummy’ or ‘empty’ or ‘artificial’ subject when there is no subject attached to the verb, or where the real subject is somewhere else in the clause. 

‘It’ and  ‘There’ are the two dummy subjects used in English

###### Examples:

<b>It</b> is hard. (real subject is missing)

<b>It</b> is always interesting <b>to find out about your personality type</b>. (We can rephrase the sentence to find the real subject)<br>
<b>To find out about your personality type</b> is always interesting. (Real subject - To find out about your personality type)

<b>There</b> are <b>five students</b> in the class. (We can rephrase the sentence to find the real subject)<br>
<b>Five students</b> are there in the class. (Real subject - Five students; Verb - are)

<b>There</b> is <b>one student</b> in the class. (We can rephrase the sentence to find the real subject)<br>
<b>One student</b> is there in the class. (Real subject - One student; Verb - is)

## Subject in Interrogative sentences 

Find out the verb and ask: what + verb OR who + verb?

In an interrogative sentence, the subject is being asked about.

Are <b>you</b> coming to the party? (Subject - you)<br>
When do <b>kids</b> want to go to bed? (Subject - kids)<br>
Is <b>the tree</b> shedding its leaves? (Subject - the tree)<br>
Have <b>you</b> eaten breakfast?   (Subject - you) <br>
<b>Who</b> is hiding behind the curtain? (Subject - Who)

## Subject in Imperative sentences 

In Imperative sentences, the hidden subject is always YOU.

Open the door. <br>
Keep away from fire. <br>
John, come here.   (here John is not the subject. It is a noun in vocative case and not subjective case.)

## Subject in Exclamatory sentences 

Find out the verb and ask: what + verb OR who + verb?

What an intelligent boy <b>he</b> is! (Subject - he) <br>
How vast <b>the desert</b> is! (Subject - the desert)
