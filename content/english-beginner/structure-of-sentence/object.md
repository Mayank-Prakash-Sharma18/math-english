Here we will focus on the Direct Object.

## Object

Sentence structure: Subject + Verb + Object

Object – a noun or pronoun (person, place, animal, or thing) that receives the action of the verb.

Saurabh broke <b>the glass</b>. (Verb - broke; Object - the glass)

{{% alert note %}}
Note: In passive voice sentences, the object of preposition ‘by’ does the action (hence called doer), and the passive subject/receiver receives that action. 
E.g. The glass was broken by Saurabh. (glass – passive subject/receiver; Saurabh – object of preposition/doer)
We will study about it in Voice module.

## Recognizing Object

If we ask a verb what? or whom? - then the answer that is on the right side of the verb is the object of that verb (in declarative sentences). 

The dog bit <b>the security guard</b>. (The dog bit whom?)

The people rang <b>the bell</b>. (The people rang what?)

{{% alert note %}}
In general, the subject and the object refer to separate entities.
{{% /alert %}}

Exception: What if the subject is its own direct object? <br>
He killed him. (refers to two entities) <br>
He killed himself. (refers to one entity) <br>

## What can be an object?

Just like subject, object may be a noun, noun phrase, pronoun or a subordinate clause. 

Architects build <b>buildings</b>. (Object is a Noun)

The Rajputs of Mewad love <b>fighting</b>. (Object is a Gerund, working as a Noun)

The foolish owl tried <b>to sing</b>. (Object is an Infinitive, working as a Noun)

All emphatic people pity <b>the poor</b>. (Object is an Adjective, working as a Noun)

Software engineers often leave <b>some bugs in the initial versions of the software</b>. (Object is a Noun Phrase)

She likes <b>getting up before the sun rises</b>. (Object is a Gerund phrase, working as a Noun Phrase)

Allied soldiers tried <b>to scale the cliff in Normandy beach</b>. (Object is an Infinitive phrase, working as Noun phrase)

I know <b>him</b>. (Object is a Pronoun)

I do not know <b>whether she will qualify the examination</b>. (Object is a Subordinate clause)

## Object-Word

Object-word - chief word (noun or pronoun) in the complete Object.

Object-word is not as significant as the Subject-word, as it has no influence on the main verb of the sentence.

Objective Case - Objects are always in the objective case. <br>
She saw <b>him</b>. <br>
Matthew watched <b>them</b> play. 
{{% /alert %}}

## Position of Object

Subject + Verb + Object

The subject usually comes before the verb and the object usually comes after the verb.

In passive voice it’s the other way round. 

Saurabh broke the glass. (active voice) <br>
The glass was broken by Saurabh. (passive voice)

## Verbal Object

Verbals - they are infinitives, gerunds and participles

Verbals function as adjectives or nouns but they retain some of the characteristics of verb, e.g. they can take an object after them. 

As a navy cadet, I was made <b>to walk</b> the plank. (to walk what? - the plank) 

<b>Driving</b> a vintage car is a treat. (driving what? - a vintage car)

<b>Watching</b> the Delhi Half Marathon, I noticed one runner taking a lift on a bike. (watching what? - the Delhi Half Marathon)
