## Transitive Verbs (Vt)

Transitive Verb - a verb that denotes an action which <strong>passes over</strong> from the Subject to an Object.

Hence, <strong>Transitive verbs are followed by an object</strong>. Such a verb doesn’t sound good or work on its own without an object.

The boy kicked. (incorrect as kicked is a transitive verb)

The boy <b>kicked</b> the ball.

* Common mistake: Many students leave out objects after transitive verbs.

Andrew took to the mall. (Andrew took whom or what?) <br>
Andrew <b>took</b> his son to the mall.

Julia left on the floor. (Julia left whom or what?) <br>
Julia <b>left</b> the bag on the floor.

* In case of no object, always use an appropriate dummy object for the verb. 

My son needed a bike therefore I gave him some money to buy. (buy what?) <br>
My son needed a bike therefore I gave him some money to buy it. 

## Intransitive Verbs (Vi)

The man laughed. (man – subject; laughed – verb; Where is the object?)

Intransitive verbs do not require an object to act upon (i.e. sentence will make sense even without an object).

All of them can end a sentence. Some intransitive verbs can even make comprehensible one-word sentences. <br>
Run! <br>
Sing! <br>

An Intransitive Verb is:
* a verb that denotes an <strong>Action</strong> which does not pass over to an object.<br>
He <b>ran</b> fast.	 	

* or a verb which expresses a <strong>State</strong>.<br>
The baby <b>sleeps</b>. 		

* or a verb which expresses <strong>Being</strong>.<br>
There <b>is</b> a flaw in this design.

* Transitive verbs can have a passive form.

Thieves <b>stole</b> his bike. (active)

His bike <b>was stolen</b> by thieves. (passive)

* Intransitive verbs never have a passive form (because there is no direct object). 

He <b>lives</b> like a king.  (active)


## Transitive – Intransitive Interchangeability 

Most verbs can be used both as Transitive and as Intransitive verbs. 

To find out whether a verb is being used transitively or intransitively - determine whether the verb has an object (i.e. ask verb + what OR verb + whom). 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Verb used Transitively</th>
    <th>Verb used Intransitively</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The driver <b>stopped</b> the car.</td>
    <td>The car <b>stopped</b> suddenly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The horse <b>kicked</b> the jockey.</td>
    <td>This horse never <b>kicks</b>.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>The Germans <b>fought</b> the French.</td>
    <td>Some Germans <b>fight</b> very fiercely.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I <b>closed</b> the door.</td>
    <td>The door <b>closed</b>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

* Sometimes the meaning changes depending on whether the verb is transitive or intransitive.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Verb used Transitively</th>
    <th>Verb used Intransitively</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>He <b>runs</b> a small manufacturing company. (runs - manage)</td>
    <td>He <b>runs</b> in the park every morning. (runs - to run)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Do <b>take off</b> your shoes before entering the temple. (take off - remove)</td>
    <td>The airplane will <b>take off</b> in a few minutes. (take off - fly)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

* Some verbs denote actions which cannot be done to anything - so they can never be used transitively.

The valiant soldier <b>died</b> in action.

Aanya <b>fell</b> on the ground while playing basketball.

{{% alert note %}}
In a good dictionary, verbs will be listed as transitive, intransitive, or both. <br>
vi (intransitive verb) and vt (transitive verb). <br>
Any possible differences in meaning between the two uses will be given as well.
