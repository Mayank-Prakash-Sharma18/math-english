###### Types of Complements

Here we will focus on Linking verb and subject complement.

## Linking Verbs and Subject Complement

Sometimes the verb is neither enough on its own, nor does it take any object after it. 

To make a meaningful sentence we sometimes require some word(s) after the verb which are not objects - Hence called Intransitive Verb of Incomplete Predication.

Compare these sentences:

The baby sleeps. (sounds complete)

The baby seems. (sounds incomplete) <br>
The baby seems happy. (Object is missing; happy is a subject complement; seems is a linking verb)

* A subject complement is a word or phrase that follows a linking verb and identifies or describes the subject.

The baby seems <b>happy</b>. <br>
Happy is the complement here, as happy is not a separate entity. Baby is the one who is happy, i.e. baby = happy.

Note that an object does not function as a subject complement; that is, it does not describe the subject. Object is a separate entity altogether. On the other hand subject and subject complement refer to the same entity.

* A linking verb connects the subject of the sentence to subjective complement (that gives information about the subject). 

Subject + Linking Verb + Subjective Complement

If we can substitute any verb with an equal sign [=] and the sentence still makes sense, the verb is almost always a linking verb.

Rohit is an engineer. (Rohit = engineer)

## List of linking verbs

Some linking verbs – be (is, am, are, was, were), appear, become, feel, get, go, grow, look, seem, taste, turn etc.

Any verb that can be replaced by a "be" linking verb - is a linking verb.

The ice on the roof **grew** thicker by the moment. <br>
The ice on the roof **was** thicker by the moment.

He **appears** crazy. <br>
He **is** crazy.

Although we call verbs as linking, intransitive and transitive verbs (just as most trainers, grammar books and websites do), it is not entirely accurate. 

A verb may be a linking, intransitive or transitive verb, based on how it has been used in a sentence (it is context based).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Verb - grow</th>
    <th>Verb type in the sentence</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The sky grew dark.</td>
    <td>Working as linking verb</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Trees grow slowly.</td>
    <td>Working as intransitive verb</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I grow banana trees.</td>
    <td>Working as transitive verb</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Object vs. Subject Complement

An object receives the action of the subject, while subject complement adds additional information about the subject.

Nicole is **tired**.    (tired is a subject complement. Both are talking about the same entity.)

I have a **ball**.  (ball is an object. I and ball are separate entities.)

Jim made the **cake** for **Victoria**.   (the cake is direct object; Victoria is prepositional object. There is no complement as no word comes for another word. There are three separate entities in this sentence.)

## What can function as subject complement?

* Subjective complement may be a <strong>noun/noun phrase or pronoun</strong> (they rename the subject; also called predicate nouns or predicate nominatives):

Saturn is **a planet**. (noun)  (Saturn = planet)

It is **I**. (pronoun)              (It = I)

The result is **that she is injured**. (noun phrase)

My favorite activity is **surfing in the ocean**. (gerund phrase working as noun phrase)

* Subjective complement may be an <strong>adjective/adjective phrase</strong> (they describe or modify the subject; also called predicate adjectives):

The sky grew **dark**. (adjective)   (sky = dark)

The house is **in prime condition**. (preposition phrase working as an adjective phrase)   
(house = in prime condition)

The manager seems **worried**. (participle) (manager = worried)

The shop is **to let**. (infinitive)  (shop = to let)

My habit is **to sleep early**. (infinitive phrase)  (my habit = to sleep early)

 Don't use an adverb as a subject complement - Because subject complement describes the subject and not the verb, so it cannot be an adverb.   

This soup tastes badly. (incorrect)<br>
This soup tastes bad. (correct)

He spoke intelligently. (incorrect) <br>
He seems intelligent. (correct)

## Case of Subject Complement

<strong>Subject complement is in subjective case</strong> - because a subject complement provides more information about the subject.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Subjective form</th>
    <th>Objective form</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I</td>
    <td>me</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>we</td>
    <td>us</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>you</td>
    <td>you</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>he, she, it </td>
    <td>him, her, it</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>they</td>
    <td>them</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>who</td>
    <td>whom</td>
  </tr>
</table>

I didn’t kick you! It was **he**. <br>
(It = subject; was = linking verb; he = subject complement.)
