Every sentence has two parts:

* The part which names the person, thing or idea we are speaking about (focus of the sentence). - Subject of the sentence. (except in Imperative sentences) 

* The part which tells something about the Subject. - Predicate of the sentence. <br>
Includes - Verb,  Object,  Complement,  Adjunct

Mragank broke the chair. (Mragank - subject; broke the chair - predicate)

Note: In active voice sentences subject is the doer of the action (it is active), while in passive voice sentences, subject is the receiver of the action (it is passive). We will study about it in Voice module.

## Subject

Verb  -  a  word  used  to  describe  an  <strong>action or  state</strong>.

Verb is the  <strong>main  part  of  the  predicate</strong>  of  a  sentence.  

Subject  -  the  person  or  thing  doing  the  action  or  experiencing the state  described  by  the  verb.

<b>Mragank</b> broke the chair. (Mragank - subject doing the action; broke - action verb)

<b>Mragank</b> needs help. (Mragank - subject experiencing the state; needs - state verb)

## Subject identification

To determine the subject of a sentence:

* Identify the verb 
* Ask a question by placing who? or what? before the verb
* The answer is the subject.

Mragank broke the chair. <br>
Who broke the chair? - Mragank

My brother Mragank broke the red chair. <br>
Who broke the red chair? - My brother Mragank

My brother Mragank from Sydney broke the red chair that was gifted to us by Mr. Agrawal. <br>
Who broke the red chair that was gifted to us by Mr. Agrawal? - My brother Mragank from Sydney

## Simplest  &  Shortest  sentence

Simplest and shortest  sentence is just a verb.

<pre> Go.     Come.      Sit. </pre>

In  Imperative  sentences  the  Subject  is  left  out:

Sit  down.  [Here  the  Subject  You  is  understood].  

Thank  him.  [Here  too  the  Subject  You  is  understood.]

A  sentence  (except  Imperative  sentences)  must  have  a  subject  and  a  verb.

## Subject  +  Verb

Verb alone can form the Predicate. 

Birds  <b>fly</b>. (Birds - subject; fly - verb)

I <b>know</b>. (I - subject; know - verb)

Here  Predicate  =  Verb

Every sentence must have a verb. <br>
Every verb must have a subject. 
(though it may not be stated explicitly in some cases, e.g. imperative sentences.)

* The verb maybe one word or multiple words.

Dogs <b>bark</b>.  

Villagers <b>are gathering</b>.

* The  form of  verb  that  we  will  use  will  depend  on  the  subject (Subject-Verb agreement). 

He <b>plays</b>.

You  <b>play</b>.

They  <b>play</b>.

Aanya  <b>plays</b>.
