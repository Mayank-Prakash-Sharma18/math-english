## Object Complement

Some Verbs require a Complement in addition to the Object (<strong>Transitive Verb of Incomplete Predication</strong>).

An object complement is similar to a subject complement, but it modifies an object rather than a subject. 

Compare the following sentences:

The horse seems **tired**. (horse - subject; tired - subject complement; horse = tired)

He considers the horse **tired**. (horse - object; tired - object complement; horse = tired)

Objective complement and object refer to the same entity.  
{{% /alert %}}

Verbs related to judging, perceiving, or changing something can, in general, cause their direct objects to take an object complement:

The jury judged him guilty. (judging)

I saw the monster sleeping. (perceiving)

Paint it blue. (changing something)

### Object Complement Vs. Indirect Object

Let us understand the difference using the following sentences:

Aanya prefers white sauce pasta. (white sauce pasta - direct object)

Aanya gave him white sauce pasta. (white sauce pasta - direct object; him - indirect object)
(direct object and indirect object are referring to different entities)

Aanya considers him a genius. (him - direct object; genius - object complement) 
(object and object complement are referring to the same entity)

### What can function as object complement?

* Objective complement may be a <strong>noun /noun phrase or pronoun</strong> (they rename the object):

The boys made Mohit **the house captain**. (noun)  (Mohit = the house captain)

Mrs. Dixit named her husband **the nominee of her insurance policy**. (noun phrase)
(husband = the nominee of her insurance policy)

They may not select me **either**. (pronoun)

* Objective complement may be an <strong>adjective /adjective phrase</strong> (they describe or modify the object):

The committee found him **careless**. (adjective) (him = careless)

The excitement of the trip got the young students **way too hyper**. (adjective phrase)

Adjectives working as object complements must follow the direct object they are describing. Adjectives that come before a noun are called as attributive adjectives (which are not necessary to complete the meaning of the sentence), e.g. **young** students.

## Adverbial Complement

Adverbial complements - adverbs (or adverbial elements) that are necessary to complete the meaning of the verb.

{{% alert note %}}
Verb + how, when, where, why = adverbial complement
{{% /alert %}}

He is **in the backyard**. (adverb – Where?)      (We cannot say that he = backyard)

The storm lasted **all night**. (adverb – When?)     (We cannot say that storm = all night) 

Syria now lies **in ruins**. (adverb – How?)     (We cannot say that Syria = in ruins) 

### Adverbial Complement Vs. Adverbials

Adverbials are the words or phrases that function as an adverb, i.e. adverbs, adverb phrases etc.

Adverbial Complement are those Adverbials that function as a complement. 

She is **in the pool**. (in the pool is an adverbial complement. It's necessary to complete the sentence.)

He was walking **rapidly**. (rapidly is an adverbial adjunct. It’s not necessary to complete the sentence.)

### Position of Adverbial Complements

Adverbial complements always appear after the verb they complement. There are two possible positions. 

* If the verb is intransitive, the adverbial complement will come directly after the verb. 

The dinner is **on the table**. 

* If the verb is transitive, the adverbial complement will come after the direct object.

He placed the pizza **in the oven**. 

* Adverb complements usually come at the end of a sentence. But if there are other adverbs too, then these complements will be placed before them. 

Put the coin **in the wallet** at once. (<s>Put the coin at once in the wallet.</s>)

Katy Perry sang **well** last night. (<s>Katy Perry sang last night well.</s>)

### What can function as Adverbial Complement?

* Adverbial complement may be an <strong>adverb/adverb phrase</strong>: 

Your car is ***there***. (adverb) 

We have been travelling ***for three days***. (adverb phrase) 

* Adverbial complement may be an <strong>adverbial object</strong>  (noun functioning as an adverb): 

Jim went ***home***. (adverbial object)
