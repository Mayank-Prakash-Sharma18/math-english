## Subject

The Subject is always a noun (or noun phrase), pronoun or a subordinate clause. 

Thus, Subject may consist of one word or several words. 

Examples:

<b>Tom</b> tried his best. (noun) 

<b>Swimming</b> is good for health. (gerund working as a noun.)

<b>To err</b> is human. (infinitive working as a noun.)

<b>The poor</b> are always victimized. (adjective working as a noun)

<b>The boys in the classroom</b> are creating a lot of noise. (noun phrase) 

<b>Swimming in the lake everyday</b> is good for health. (gerund phrase working as a noun phrase)

<b>To eat nutritious food</b> is necessary for health.  (infinitive phrase working as a noun phrase)

<b>Being honest</b> is rare these days.   (present participle phrase working as a noun phrase)

<b>They</b> are jealous. (pronoun)

<b>What she said</b> is untrue. (subordinate clause)

## Subject-word

Subject may be of one word or more than one word. When subject is of more than one word, then the word that is the most important is called the subject-word. 

Subject-word  - chief word (noun or pronoun) in the complete Subject.

* In a sentence the main verb is always according to the subject-word.

The condition of people in slums is miserable. (subject-word - condition and not slums)

The time to prepare lessons <s>have</s> arrived. (incorrect) <br>
The time to prepare lessons has arrived. (subject-word - time and not lessons)

## Subject and Preposition

Subject-word never comes after preposition - A prepositional phrase will never contain the subject of a sentence. What comes after preposition is the object of preposition.

In case of some expressions (e.g., "half of"), the object of the preposition does influence the verb.<br>

Predicate may also consist of one word or several words. But Predicate will always have a Verb.
