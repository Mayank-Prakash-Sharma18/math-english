Words are divided into different classes, called Parts of Speech, according to their use in a sentence. 

The parts of speech are eight in number:
1. Noun        
2. Adjective        
3. Pronoun
4. Verb
5. Adverb   
6. Preposition      
7. Conjunction     
8. Interjection

## Verb

A Verb is a word used to express an action or state. 

The boy <b>wrote</b> a letter to his dad. (wrote – an action)

Bristol <b>is</b> a big city.  (is – a state)

Verbs are the most important words in English language. Two main reasons: <br>
a. Every sentence in English must have a verb. <br>
b. Verbs are the only parts of speech that can denote tenses.

## Noun

A Noun is a word used as the name of a person, place, or thing. Also, ideas, abstract things, e.g. happiness, time etc.

Nouns are sometimes called ‘naming words’.

<b>Ashoka</b> was a king.

<b>Aanya</b> went to <b>Andaman</b> on <b>vacation</b> with her <b>husband</b> last year.

## Pronoun

A Pronoun is a word used instead of a noun. It replaces a noun. 

Mragank is absent, because <b>Mragank</b> is ill. (sounds odd)<br>
Mragank is absent, because <b>he</b> is ill. (he - Subject pronoun) 

The cards are where you left <b>the cards</b>. (sounds odd)<br>
The cards are where you left <b>them</b>. (them - Object pronoun) 

* Subject pronouns – Used to replace a noun in subject positions
I, you, we, they, he, she, it

* Object pronouns – Used to replace a noun in object positions
me, you, us, them, him, her, it

## Adjective

An Adjective is a word used to add something to the meaning of a noun or pronoun.

Adjectives are sometimes called ‘describing words’.

Ashoka was a king.  <br>
Ashoka was a <b>great</b> king.  

He is a boy. <br>
He is a <b>brave</b> boy. 

There are boys in this club. <br>
There are <b>forty</b> boys in this club. 

## Adverb

An Adverb is a word used to add something to the meaning of a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. They answer the questions Where, When, How, Why.

The boy wrote a letter to her dad. <br>
The boy <b>quickly</b> wrote a letter to her dad. (wrote – verb; How? - quickly, an adverb modifying the verb wrote) 

He is a brave boy. <br>
He is a <b>very</b> brave boy. (brave - adjective; very - adverb modifying the adjective brave) 

She pronounced the word. <br>
She pronounced the word <b>correctly</b>. (pronounced – verb; correctly - adverb modifying the verb pronounced) <br>
She pronounced the word <b>quite</b> correctly. (quite - adverb modifying the adverb correctly) 

* They may even add meaning to a whole sentence. 

We went on a walk.<br>
<b>Yesterday evening</b>, we went on a walk. (went – verb; When? - Yesterday evening)
<img src="../../../media/english-introduction/adverb.png" alt="adverb" style="width:11%;height:11%;">

They missed the bus and were late to their own party!<br>
<b>Unfortunately</b>, they missed the bus and were late to their own party! (Unfortunately - adverb)

So both adjectives and adverbs add something to the meaning, i.e. they give some extra information. 

## Preposition

A Preposition is a word used with a noun or a pronoun to show how the person or thing denoted by the noun or pronoun stands in relation to something else. 

* Prepositions can add idea of time, place and movement to noun/pronoun.

There is a butterfly <b>in</b> the garden. (in – Place - Where?) 
<img src="../../../media/english-introduction/preposition.png" alt="preposition" style="width:11%;height:11%;">

I'll see you <b>at</b> the office <b>on</b> Tuesday. (at – Place - Where? ; on – Time - When?)

The driver moved <b>towards</b> the door. (towards - Movement) 

* Prepositions can connect other words to a noun/pronoun

It depends <b>on</b> the cost. (here the preposition ‘on’ links the noun ‘the cost’ with the verb ‘depends’)

## Conjunction

A Conjunction is a word used to join words, phrases, clauses or sentences. 

Conjunctions are sometimes called ‘joining words’.

Mragank <b>and</b> Anand are cousins. 

I ran fast. I missed the bus. <br>
I ran fast, <b>but</b> missed the bus. 
<img src="../../../media/english-introduction/conjunction.png" alt="conjunction" style="width:18%;height:18%;">

## Interjection

An Interjection is a word which expresses some sudden emotion. 

They don’t have any real meaning. 

<b>Alas!</b> She is dead. 

<b>Wow!</b> What a sight. 
<img src="../../../media/english-introduction/interjection.png" alt="interjection" style="width:11%;height:11%;">

Interjections are used more commonly in speech and less in writing.

In writing they are often followed by an exclamation point (i.e. !).
