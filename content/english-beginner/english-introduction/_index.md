## Letters

English alphabet has 26 letters. 

Each letter is a symbol for a sound. E.g. A, B, C, D etc.

Vowels - A, E, I, O, and U

Other letters - Consonants

You most often than not need a vowel to make a word. 

## Words

Word: It is a collection of letters that makes some sense.

Monkey <br>
You <br>
There <br><br>
So, we combine letters to make words. 

## Phrase, Clause or Sentence

Word is a single distinct meaningful element of speech or writing, used with others (or sometimes alone) to form a phrase, clause or a sentence.<br>
Can you see the monkey over there?
