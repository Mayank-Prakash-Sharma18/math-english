Words are divided into different classes according to the work they do in sentences. 

* Some words always do only one work.

E.g. Believe and destroy can only be verbs. Independence can only be a noun. 

* But some words do different work depending on their use in the sentence. 

We cannot say to which part of speech such a word belongs unless we see it used in a sentence. 

Mragank has been chosen for the school <b>play</b>. (Noun) <br>
Federer and Nadal <b>play</b> tennis together on Saturdays. (Verb)

We ate in the <b>afternoon</b>. (Noun) <br>
We had <b>afternoon</b> tea. (Adjective)

They arrived soon <b>after</b>. (Adverb) <br>
They arrived <b>after</b> us. (Preposition) <br>
They arrived <b>after</b> we had left. (Conjunction)

Are you <b>well</b>? (Adjective)<br>
She speaks <b>well</b>. (Adverb)<br>
<b>Well!</b> That's expensive! (Interjection)

I am staying <b>in</b> this evening. (in - adverb)<br>
Look <b>in</b> the big box. (in – preposition)

So, Parts of speech is context based. 
You cannot memorize the words as belonging to one or the other part of speech. You will have to look at the sentence and find out what work a word is performing in that sentence.
