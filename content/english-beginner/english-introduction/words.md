## Different types of words

Words are divided into different classes according to their function. These classes are called <strong>parts of speech</strong>.

There are 8 classes of words:
noun, pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction, interjection

Some modern grammar books have one more class - determiners <br>
Articles (a, an, the) also fall under the category of determiners.
