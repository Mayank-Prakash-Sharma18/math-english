## Position of Adverbs of frequency 

Adverbs of frequency answer the question 'How often?' 

E.g., always, never, often, rarely, usually, generally and certain other adverbs like almost, already, hardly, nearly, just, quite.

### Concept 1

They are normally put in mid position (there are a few exceptions though, that we will study later). 

There are two possible kinds of mid-positions:

* if the verb consists of only one word, then they come between the subject and the verb. <br>
Subject + Adverb of frequency + Verb <br>
Her husband ***never*** cooks. (husband – subject; cooks – one word verb)

* if there is more than one word in the verb, then they are put after the first word. <br>
Subject + Helping verb + Adverb of frequency + Main Verb <br>
She has ***never*** seen a bear. (She – subject; has – helping verb; seen – main verb)

### Concept 2

These adverbs are usually put before a helping verb when it is stressed.

Subject + Adverb of frequency + Helping verb (stressed) + Main Verb

When will you complete your homework? - I ***already*** have completed it. (have - stressed)

### Concept 3

If the verb is single verb ‘be’ (i.e. is/am/are/was), these adverbs are placed after the verb (so whether ‘be’ is used as helping verb or main verb, adverb of frequency will come after it).

Subject + be + Adverb of frequency 

He is ***always*** at gym on Saturdays. (He – subject; is – verb)

These adverbs are usually put before the single verb ‘be’,  when it is stressed.

Subject + Adverb of frequency + be (stressed) + Main Verb

I ***usually*** am busy on Tuesdays. (am - stressed)

When a helping verb is used alone in ***short responses***, it is stressed and therefore the adverb of frequency comes before it.

Do you watch Breaking Bad? - Yes, I ***sometimes*** do. (do - stressed)

### Concept 4

These helping verbs prefer the adverb of frequency in front of them:
* have to  
* used to

Subject + Adverb of frequency + used to/have to + $V_1$
 
I ***often*** have to go to sleep hungry.

He ***always*** used to taunt me.

### Concept 5

There are exceptions to the rule that adverbs of frequency occupy the mid position. That is, they may occupy front or end positions too. 

Let's see some of these exceptions. 

#### Exception 1

Some adverbs of indefinite frequency can also go in front or end position

E.g. normally, occasionally, sometimes, and usually.

I ***normally*** bowl, but ***sometimes*** I bat. (normally – mid-position; sometimes – front position)

#### Exception 2

Adverbs of indefinite frequency which have a negative meaning can go in front position.

E.g. hardly, hardly ever, barely, scarcely, never, rarely, seldom, at no time, not once.

Here the subject will come after an helping verb or a main verb ‘be’.

Negative Adverb of indefinite frequency + Helping verb + Subject

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Never we had</span>*** encountered such a challenge. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Never had we</span>*** encountered such a challenge. (correct; had – helping verb; we - subject)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Not once he was</span>*** at his seat when I inspected. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Not once was he</span>*** at his seat when I inspected. (correct; was – main verb ‘be’; he - subject)

{{% alert note %}}
Hardly/Scarcely/Barely/Never/Seldom are negative words. So, we can't use another negative word with them.

Hardly we do ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">not</span>*** know him. (incorrect) <br>
Hardly do we know him. (correct)

You will notice that:

* An Adverbs of frequency comes at the position of 'not' <br><br>
She is ***never*** late. (She is ***not*** late.) <br>
He ***hardly*** plays now. (He ***does not*** play now.) <br>
He ***often*** has to proof read. (He ***did not*** have to proof read.)

* If ‘not’ is already present, an adverb of frequency comes after not. <br><br>
He has not ***ever*** done it.

## Mutual order of Adverbs of place, frequency and time

If there are adverbs of place, frequency and time in a sentence, then we use them in this order:

Subject + Verb ..... + Adverb of (place + frequency + time) 

Meenakshi comes here every other day now-a-days. <br>
(here – adverb of place; every other day – adverb of frequency; now-a-days – adverb of time)

<br><hr><br>

## Position of Adverbs of degree

Adverbs of degree – give information about the extent or degree of something.

E.g. extremely, really, almost, completely, fairly, quite, rather, slightly, too, totally, very (much).

### Concept 1

They are used before adjectives, verbs, or other adverbs. Note that they come just before an adjective or another adverb. 

He ***really*** hates travelling by bus. (really – adverb of degree; hates - verb) <br>
She is ***extremely*** happy. (extremely - adverb of degree; happy - adjective) <br>
He's ***almost*** always late. (almost - adverb of degree; always – adverb of frequency)

### Concept 2

If there is more than one word in the verb, then adverbs of degree are put after the first word (just as is the case with adverbs of frequency).

Pattern: Subject + Helping verb + Adverb of degree + Main Verb

She will ***completely*** destroy me. (will – helping verb; destroy – main verb)

### Concept 3

If the verb is single verb ‘be’ (i.e. is/am/are/was), these adverbs are placed after the verb (so whether ‘be’ is used as helping verb or main verb, adverb of degree will come after it, just as is the case with adverbs of frequency).

Pattern: Subject + be + Adverb of degree

He is ***really*** into this gig. (He – subject; is – verb)
