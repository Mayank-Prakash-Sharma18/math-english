## Position of Adverbs of comment

Most adverbs of comment can occur at the front, middle or end of a sentence.

***Personally***, I'd be happy if they get married. <br>
He wanted to sell me some quilts that had ***obviously*** some quality issues. <br>
He has done his masters from a top-notch university, ***apparently***.

To show that they apply to the whole sentence, we usually separate them from the rest of the sentence by a comma.
{{% /alert %}}

## Position of Adverbs of focus

'even' and 'only' usually go in mid position. But there may be exceptions. 

Generally, the words ‘only’ and ‘even’ should be placed immediately before the word (noun/pronoun) they modify.   

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">My brother only</span>*** can win this competition. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Only my brother</span>*** can win this competition. (correct – it means my brother and nobody else)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">A child even</span>*** can solve this problem. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Even a child</span>*** can solve this problem. (correct)

When we use ‘alone’ to mean 'only', it comes after a noun/pronoun:

You won’t be able to ride up the corporate ladder by hard work ***alone***. (hard work – noun, it is the object of the preposition ‘by’)

In spoken English, however the words ‘only’ and ‘even’ are usually put before the verb. Then to convey the required meaning we stress the word which ‘only’ or ‘even’ modify.

I have ***only*** slept three hours. (stress on 'three hours') <br>
He can ***even*** speak Sanskrit. (stress on 'Sanskrit')

### Position of Only

We generally keep an adverb adjacent to the word it modifies. If we change the position of an adverb, it may even change the meaning of the sentence.

Let us see some examples involving the adverb ‘only’. Students often make errors in the proper positioning of this adverb. 

***Only*** he heard my story. (My story was heard by just one person) <br>
He ***only*** heard my story. (He did not do anything else) <br>
He heard ***only*** my story. (He did not hear the story of any other person) <br>
He heard my ***only*** story. (I had  just one story) <br>
He heard my story ***only***. (Not my poems, essay etc.)
