Some Adverbs have three degrees of comparison (just like Adjectives). Such Adverbs are generally compared like Adjectives.

### Concept 1

If the Adverb is of one syllable:

* we form the Comparative by addig er to the Positive, and 
* we form the Superlative by adding est to the Positive.

Mragank ran ***fast***. (Positive) <br>
Anand ran ***faster***. (Comparative) <br>
Mayank ran ***fastest*** of all. (Superlative)

### Concept 2

If the positive form of Adverb ends in ly:

* we form the Comparative by adding more and 
* we form the Superlative by adding most.

Gavaskar played ***skilfully***. (Positive) <br>
Sachin played ***more skilfully*** than Gavaskar. (Comparative) <br>
Of all the players Rohit played ***most skilfully***. (Superlative)	

But there are some exceptions: <br>
E.g. early, earlier, earliest.

### Concept 3

Some of the commonest Adverbs form their Comparative and Superlative degrees irregularly.

Aanya plays ***well***. <br>
He works ***more*** than you do. <br>
Anand works the ***most*** amongst us.

{{% alert note %}}
Only Adverbs of Manner, Degree, and Time have different degrees of comparison. 

Many Adverbs, from their nature, cannot be compared. <br>
E.g. now, then, where, there, once.
