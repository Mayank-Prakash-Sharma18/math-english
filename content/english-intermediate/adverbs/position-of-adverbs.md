## Position of Adverbs when they modify Verbs

Adverbs which modify a verb can come in three main positions:

<img src="../../../media/adverbs/position-of-adverbs.png" alt="position of adverbs" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

### Front position

#### Concept 1

Most types of adverbs can go in front position. 

In particular:

#### Concept 2

Interrogative adverb is always used in the beginning of a sentence.

***When*** are you planning to join college?

#### Concept 3

Adverbs are also used at the beginning of a sentence:

* in order to modify a complete sentence, an adverb is used at the beginning of a sentence. <br>
***Surely***, this task will be done by tomorrow.

* In order to emphasize the adverb. <br>
***Here*** comes the railway minister. <br>
***Off*** he goes.

### Mid position

#### Concept 1

The following types of adverb usually go in mid position: 

* adverbs of indefinite frequency (e.g. always, never, usually). <br>
She ***always*** cries when she's emotional.

* degree adverbs (e.g. completely, quite) <br>
I ***completely*** lost my cool. 

* focus adverbs (e.g. just, even) <br>
We ***just*** wanted to help him.

#### Concept 2

Most adverbs of time or place don't go in mid-position:

Aanya ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">in August</span>*** had a baby. (incorrect) <br>
Aanya had a baby ***<span class="mak-text-color">in August</span>***. (correct)

But some of them do (e.g. including already, finally, now, recently, soon, still) <br>
I ***finally*** met Anand in a small town in Uttarakhand.

Adverbs of time are often used in mid position in journalism, i.e. while reporting: <br>
The President ***yesterday*** announced that Article 2893 will be abolished.

### End position

#### Concept 1

Some adverbs go in end position too.

Subject + Verb + Adverb 

You danced ***beautifully***.

#### Concept 2

We usually put an adverb after an object or complement:

Pattern: Subject + Verb + (Object) + Adverb 

He studied ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">briefly</span>*** the problem. (incorrect) <br>
He studied the problem ***<span class="mak-text-color">briefly</span>***. (correct; problem – object; briefly - adverb)

However, if an object or complement is very long, then we often put an adverb between the verb and its object or complement (generally done in journalism while reporting)

Pattern: Subject + Verb + Adverb + (Object) 

Military considered ***briefly*** the possibility of a nuclear attack. (briefly – adverb; possibility - object)

## Position of Adverbs when they modify Adjectives and other Adverbs

When an adverb modifies an adjective or another adverb, the adverb usually comes before it.

The novel is ***very*** interesting. (very – adverb; interesting - adjective)

Kindly do not dictate ***so*** fast. (so – adverb; fast - adverb)

{{% alert note %}}
adverb ‘enough’ is always placed after the word which it modifies.

He was decent ***enough*** to ask. (decent – adjective; enough - adverb) <br>
He sang loud ***enough*** to break the glass. (loud – adverb; enough - adverb)
