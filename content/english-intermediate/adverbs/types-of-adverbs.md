There are three major types of Adverbs:

* Simple Adverbs
* Interrogative Adverbs
* Relative Adverbs

Let's study them in more detail.

## Simple Adverbs

There are various kinds of Simple Adverbs. 

### Adverbs of Place 

Adverbs of Place – they answer the question ‘where’.

E.g. here, there, in, out, above, below, away, far, away, up, down, upstairs, downstairs, indoors, within, inside, outside, out, underneath, off, everywhere, backward.

Go ***there***. <br>
He follows me ***everywhere*** like a Hutch dog. <br>
Peace lies ***within***. <br>				 
Come ***in***. <br>

### Adverbs of Time 

Adverbs of Time – they answer the question ‘when’.

E.g. after, ago, early, before, late, lately, now, then, soon, daily, today, yesterday, tomorrow, already, never, formerly, since. 

I have saw this ***before***.	<br>			
I missed my flight ***yesterday***. <br>	
I have done it ***already***. <br>			

Adverbs of place and time show a contrast with, or expansion on, a previous reference to time or place.

The last few months have been cold.  (shows ***continuation*** over time) <br>
Tomorrow the weather will be much hotter. (shows ***contrast*** with previous time)

#### On Vs. In

For particular day or date we use ‘on’, and for a long duration we use ‘in’. 

* When we want to talk about a particular day: <br>
On + particular day <br>
E.g. On Monday

* When we want to talk about a particular date: <br>
On + particular date <br>
E.g. On 18th

* When we want to talk about a long duration: <br>
In + long duration (e.g. week, month, year, century, vacation etc) <br>
E.g. In August, in 1983, in summar vacation, in 19th century

#### In Vs. At

Let's see some use cases of 'in' and 'at'. 

##### Morning time

In the morning<br>

At day break (when darkness starts reducing)<br>
At dawn (just before sunrise when the sky starts getting reddish)<br>
At sunrise <br>
At breakfast<br>

##### Noon time

At noon (12 noon)<br>
At midday (around 2)<br>
At lunch <br>

##### Evening time

### Adverbs of Degree or Quantity 

Adverbs of Degree or Quantity - they answer the question ‘how much’, or ‘in what degree’ or ‘to what extent’.

We use them when we cannot count or measure something.

E.g. very, too, so, as, fairly, rather, quite, pretty, enough, a bit, somewhat, all, any, much, almost, fully, partly, altogether etc.

He was ***too*** good to be just a junior manager. <br>	 		
This man is ***almost*** dead. <br>
He is good ***enough*** for this job.


### Adverbs of Comment

Adverbs of Comment - they are used to ‘comment’. 

To be precise they are used :

* to indicate our attitude to or opinion of what is said - astonishingly, frankly, generally, honestly, to be honest, interestingly (enough), luckily, naturally, in my opinion, personally, sadly, seriously, surprisingly, unbelievably.

* show our judgement of someone's actions – bravely, carelessly, foolishly, generously, kindly, rightly, stupidly, wisely, wrongly.

* indicate how likely we think something is - apparently, certainly, clearly, definitely, in theory, obviously, presumably, probably, undoubtedly.

Phrases and clauses can also be used to indicate our attitude to, or opinion of, what is said (just as adverbs of comment do). 

For example:

***Surprisingly***, he didn’t ask me where I was coming from. (surprisingly – adverb of comment) <br>
***To my surprise***, he didn’t ask me where I was coming from. (To my surprise – preposition phrase working as an adverb phrase)


### Adverbs of Viewpoint

Adverbs of Viewpoint - they are used to make our point of view clear. 

E.g. financially, physically, biologically, chemically, environmentally, ideologically, logically, morally, outwardly, politically, technically, visually.

***Politically***, this action of yours is akin to hara-kiri.

The twins may be alike ***physically***, but their sports performance differs a lot.

Phrases and clauses can also be used to indicate our viewpoint (just as adverbs of viewpoint do). 

For example:

This business model should work ***technically***. (technically – adverb of viewpoint) <br>
This business model should work ***from a technical point of view***. (from a technical point of view – preposition phrase working as an adverb phrase)


### Adverbs of Affirmation and Negation

#### Adverbs of Affirmation

E.g. surely, certainly, truly, of course, at any cost, etc.

Yes - for short affirmative answer

***Of course*** I will be there in your party. 

She ***certainly*** went home.		

#### Adverbs of Negation

E.g.: no, not, never, nowhere etc.

Not - after verb/auxiliary verb <br>
No - for short negative answer

She did ***not*** reply to my call.

I have ***nowhere*** to go.


### Adverbs of Focus

Adverbs of Focus – to focus on someone.

E.g. only, even, alone etc. 

***Only*** Neo can decipher the matrix. 

***Even*** dummies can solve this puzzle. 


### Adverbs of Reason

Adverbs of Reason - they answer the question 'why’. 

E.g. so, hence, therefore, on account of, consequently etc.

***On account of*** his ill health, he won’t be playing in today’s match.

He ***therefore*** has been expelled from the school.


### Adverbs of Purpose and Results

Adverbs of Purpose and Results – to talk about purpose. 

Pattern: in order/so as + to-infinitive OR <br>
Pattern: in order/so + that

He stayed at work late ***in order / so as*** to complete the project. <br>
He stayed at work late ***in order that / so that*** he could complete the project.


### Adverbs of Contrasts

Adverbs of Contrasts – to showcase an unexpected contrast between what happened in the main clause and what happened in the adverbial clause.

E.g. although, though, even though, even if, in spite of + Ving

***Although/Though*** Mragank did not study much, he still cleared the exam. <br>
(OR Mragank did not study much, ***but*** he still cleared the exam.)

‘in spite of + Ving‘ has a similar meaning as 'although':

***In spite of playing*** with ten men, we won easily. <br>
(OR Although we played with ten men, we won easily.)

We can use ‘even though’ (but not 'even although') to mean 'despite the fact that' and ‘even if’ to mean 'whether or not'.

#### Simple Adverbs – not a watertight compartmentalization

We have seen various categories of Adverbs, but it’s not a  watertight compartmentalization. Some of the Adverbs may belong to more than one category/type.

Compare:

He sings ***delightfully***. (Adverb of Manner) <br>
The weather is ***delightfully*** cool.	(Adverb of Degree)

Don't go ***far***. (Adverb of Place) <br>
She is ***far*** better now. (Adverb of Degree)

## Interrogative Adverbs

Interrogative Adverbs - used in asking questions.

E.g. why, when, where, how.

***How*** did you do it?  (Interrogative Adverb of Manner) <br>

## Relative Adverbs

Relative Adverbs – they join sentences. They refer back to their antecedents (noun/pronoun) and denote place, reason or manner. 

E.g. when, where, why and how.

Show me the house ***where*** (= in which) he was born. <br>	 
This is the reason ***why*** I joined that team. <br>
Do you know the time ***when*** the Rajdhani Express arrives?

## Summary of Kinds of Adverbs 

You may note that:

* A Simple adverb merely modifies some word.

* An Interrogative adverb not only modifies some word, but also introduces a question.

* A Relative adverb not only modifies some word, but also refers back to some antecedent.
