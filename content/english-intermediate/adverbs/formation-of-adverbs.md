## Adverbs made from Adjectives

### Concept 1

Adverbs of Manner are mostly formed from adjectives by adding ly (a corruption of like).

E.g. clever, cleverly; wise, wisely; kind, kindly; foolish, foolishly; quick, quickly; beautiful, beautifully.

He ruled ***wisely*** for many years. (wisely - like a wise man)

### Concept 2

When an adjective ends in y preceded by a consonant, we change y into i and add ly.

E.g. happy, happily; ready, readily; heavy, heavily.

### Concept 3

When an adjective ends in le, we simply change e into y.

E.g. single, singly; double, doubly.

### Concept 4

When an adjective already ends in -ly (e.g. cowardly, friendly, kindly, lively, lonely) we don't add -ly to it to make an adverb. Instead we can use a prepositional phrase with fashion, manner, or way.

She looked at me in a ***friendly manner/way***. 	

### Concept 5

Most participle adjectives ending in -ed (past participles) don't have an adverb form and we can use a similar prepositional phrase:

Students rose to greet the teacher ***in a subdued manner***.

However, some participle adjectives ending in -ed (past participles) do have an adverb form with -ly:

E.g. allegedly, belatedly, contentedly, dejectedly, deservedly, excitedly, hurriedly, markedly, pointedly, repeatedly, reportedly, reputedly, supposedly, unexpectedly, wholeheartedly, wickedly.

They ***hurriedly*** left the room.

<!-- ### Concept 6

A few words have the same adverb and adjective forms.

E.g.: fast, long, near, straight, outright, direct, hard, early, late, loud, high, safe and quiet.

Only after observing how a word is used in a sentence can we tell what Part of Speech it is.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert note %}}
All the words that end with ly, are not adverbs. 

E.g. manly, masterly, slovenly, friendly, orderly, gentlemanly, sickly, weekly, monthly are adjectives. 

Wing commander behaved ***friendly***. (incorrect) <br>
Wing commander behaved in a ***friendly*** manner. (correct)
{{% /alert %}}

### Concept 7

Some adverbs are compounds of a preposition and an adjective.

E.g. behind, below, beyond.    -->

## Adverbs made from Pronouns 

Many adverbs are derived from pronouns the (= that), he, who.

Many of the above adverbs are compounded with prepositions. 

E.g. thereby, therefrom, therein, thereof, thereon, thereto, there with; <br>
hereafter, hereby, herein, hereupon, herewith; <br>
wherefore, wherein, whereon, whereof; <br>
hitherto; <br>
thenceforth, thenceforward; <br>
henceforth, henceforward.

## Adverbs made from other Adverbs

There are some adverbs that are compounds of a preposition and an adverb.

E.g. within, without, before, beneath.

<br><hr><br>

## Adverbs made from Nouns

### Concept 1

Some Adverbs are made up of a noun and a qualifying adjective.

E.g. sometimes, meantime, meanwhile, yesterday, midway, otherwise.

### Concept 2

Some adverbs are compounds of on (weakened to a) and a noun. <br>
E.g. afoot (= on foot), abed, asleep, ahead, aboard, away. 

Similarly, some other prepositions are also compounded with nouns to form adverbs. <br>
E.g. besides, to-day, to-morrow; overboard.

<br><hr><br>

## Two forms of Adverbs

Some adverbs have two forms:

* one ending in -ly and 
* the other not ending in -ly (which is the same as the Adjective). 

### Both forms with same meaning

Both the forms of some of these adverbs have the same meaning (although the form ending in -ly is more usual in a formal style) <br>
E.g. quick(ly), cheap(ly), clean(ly), clear(ly), fine(ly), slow(ly), thin(ly).

Come to the hospital as ***quick(ly)*** as you can. 

### Both forms with different meanings

In some cases there is a difference in the meaning of the adverb with and without –ly.

Compare:

I arrived ***late*** for the interview. 	<br>	
I haven't seen you play football ***lately***. (lately means recently)

<br><hr><br>

## Adverbs that go together

Two Adverbs sometimes go together, joined by the Conjunction ‘and’.

again and again (= more than once, repeatedly) <br>
now and then (= from time to time, occasionally) <br>
out and out (= decidedly, beyond all comparison) <br>
to and fro (= backwards and forwards, up and down).
