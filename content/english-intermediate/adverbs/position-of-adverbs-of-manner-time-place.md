## Position of Adverbs of manner

### Concept 1

Adverbs of manner (they answer the question 'How?‘) are generally placed after the verb or after the object if there is one.

E.g., well, fast, quickly, carefully, calmly.

So, these patterns are possible:

* Verb + Adverb of manner <br>
It is raining ***heavily***.
	
* Verb + Object + Adverb of manner   (if object is short) <br>
She speaks English ***well***. <br>
He does his work ***carefully***.

* Adverb of manner + Verb + Object    (if object is very long) <br>
He ***carefully*** writes a novel that he is supposed to submit by Sunday. 

* Adverb of manner + Verb  (for emphasis)     

### Concept 2

Adverb of manner comes before adjective 

Adverb of manner + Adjective 

She is ***unreasonably*** anxious. (unreasonably – adverb; anxious - adjective)

He is ***ill*** mannered. (ill – adverb; mannered – participle adjective $V_3$)

In case of adjective, we keep adverb before it. While in case of verb, we generally keep adverb after it.

### Concept 3

Away/Out/In/Off/On/Back/Forward/Home + Adverb of manner

Meenakshi looked ***back anxiously***. 

Jennifer walked ***away sadly***.

## Position of Adverbs of place and time

### Concept 1

Adverbs (or adverb phrases) of place and of time are generally placed after the verb or after the object if there is one. 

I looked ***everywhere***. (looked – verb; everywhere - adverb)

I met her ***yesterday***. (her – object; yesterday- adverb)

### Concept 2

For emphasis, adverb of time or place can be used at the beginning (before the verb or a sentence).

***There*** goes my brother. 

***Yesterday***, I saw a movie.

***Here*** it is. 

### Concept 3

We also put adverbs of place in front position to show a contrast or expansion. 

The child was eventually found ***under the bridge***. (adverb at end position) <br>
The police searched the locality and ***under the bridge*** they found a body. (adverb at front position to show expansion)

### Concept 4

#### Concept 4a

If we put an adverb of place in front position we have to put the subject after the verb 'be'.

Next to the tree ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">a pothole was</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
Next to the tree ***<span class="mak-text-color">was a pothole</span>***. (correct)

#### Concept 4b

We can also put the subject after the verb in case of ***intransitive verbs used to indicate position or movement to a position*** (e.g. hang, lie, live, sit, stand; come, fly, go, march, roll, run, swim, walk)

Through the town square ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">the army marched</span>***. (incorrect) <br> 
Through the town square ***<span class="mak-text-color">marched the army</span>***. (correct)

However, we don't do this: 
* if one of these intransitive verbs is followed by an adverb of manner, 
* with other intransitive verbs (that do not indicate position or movement to a position), or 
* with transitive verbs.

Above his head ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">hung the sword menacingly</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
Above his head ***<span class="mak-text-color">the sword hung menacingly</span>***. (correct; hung – an intransitive verb indicating position or movement to a position; menacingly - adverb of manner)

Outside the temple ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">sang the singer</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
Outside the temple ***<span class="mak-text-color">the singer sang</span>***. (correct; sang – an intransitive verb **not** indicating position or movement to a position)

At the beach ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">built Saurabh a castle</span>*** for the children. (incorrect) <br>
At the beach ***<span class="mak-text-color">Saurabh built a castle</span>*** for the children. (correct; built – transitive verb)

### Concept 5

The following types of adverbs of time usually go in front or end position, but not in mid position:

* Those which indicate a definite point or period in time or 
* Those which indicate a definite frequency.

I went to Delhi ***yesterday***. (correct; yesterday - adverb of time indicating a definite point in time) <br>
***Yesterday*** I went to Delhi. (correct)

We play football ***twice a month***. (correct; twice a month - adverb of time indicating a definite frequency) <br>
***Twice a month*** we play football. (correct)

<!-- However, some adverbs of time only go in end position (e.g. daily, hourly, monthly, weekly etc.).

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Hourly</span>*** the bus leaves old city station. (incorrect) <br>
The bus ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">hourly</span>*** leaves old city station. (incorrect) <br>
The bus leaves old city station ***<span class="mak-text-color">hourly</span>***. (correct; hourly – adverb of time) -->

## Mutual order of Adverbs of manner, place and time

When there are two or more adverbs after a verb (and its object), the normal order is adverb of manner, adverb of place, adverb of time.

The President spoke earnestly at the meeting yesterday. (earnestly - adverb of manner; at the meeting – adverb phrase of place; yesterday – adverb of time)

She played well in the stadium. (well – adverb of manner; in the stadium – adverb phrase of place)

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- ### Exceptions

#### Exception 1

If one adverb is much longer than another then it is usually placed last.

She left at 1.00 with a great deal of tantrums. (at 1.00 – adverb of time; with a great deal of tantrums – adverb of manner)

#### Exception 2

After some verbs of movements, adverb of manner will come after adverb of place. 

Subject + come/go/arrive/enter (verb of movements) + Adverb of place + Adverb of manner

The bride came in slowly. (in – adverb of place; slowly– adverb of manner) -->
