## What is a Verb?

A Verb is a word that tells or asserts something about a person or thing. 

* What a person or thing ***is***: <br>
The dog ***is*** dead. <br> 			
Steel ***is*** strong. <br>			 	
I ***feel*** happy.

* What a person or thing ***does***: <br>
Tom ***laughs***. <br>			
Lightening ***strikes***.

* What is ***done*** to a person or thing: <br>
Tom was ***punished***.	<br> 	
The water was ***spilled***.

We can also say that Verb is a word that shows: 
* an action/event/process or 
* a state. 

A Verb can be one word or more than one word.

She ***learnt*** her lesson.

She ***is learning*** her lesson.

She ***has learnt*** her lesson.

She ***has been learning*** her lesson for an hour.

She ***will have been learning*** her lesson for an hour.


## Types of Verbs

Though there are various classifications of verbs, here we will cover the most common one - Action verbs Vs. State verbs. 

### Action/Dynamic Verbs

Action verbs show physical activities, processes or physical conditions. 

run, sit, walk, climb, talk, shout, ache, itch

You should ***walk*** in a straight line. 

Julia ***told*** me an interesting story. 

Kindly ***sit*** here.


### State/Stative Verbs           

State verbs express states or conditions which are relatively static. They show a situation.  

be, have, own, like, sad, appear, belong, seem, love

He ***appears*** devastated. 

I ***have*** a beautiful house. 

I ***feel*** sad today. 


## Verbs and Continuous tenses 

State Verbs cannot be used in Continuous tenses (–ing forms). 

<s>I am ***having*** a bike.</s> I ***have*** a bike. 

<s>He is ***having*** a huge fan base.</s> He ***has*** a huge fan base. 

<s>Annie is ***liking*** the movie.</s> Annie ***likes*** the movie. 

<s>They are ***seeming*** tired.</s> They ***seem*** tired.

Only Action Verbs can be used in Continuous tenses.

Children are ***playing*** in the park.

Why are you ***yelling*** at me?


However, in some cases we can use State verbs in -ing form (i.e. in Continuous tenses). Let us have a look at these exceptions. 

### State verbs in the continuous form (Exceptions)

#### Exception 1

When state verbs refer to temporary action or an action in progress at a certain moment

I'm ***having*** second thoughts about joining this company.

Tom is ***appearing*** in this play this evening.

You're ***looking*** great in those trousers. 

#### Exception 2

When state verbs have an active meaning.

Do you ***have*** a bike? (own)	<br>
The delegates are ***having*** lunch at the moment. (process - eating)

This milk ***tastes*** sour. (has a sour taste)	<br>
