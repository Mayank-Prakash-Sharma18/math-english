## What are Finite and Non-Finite Verbs?

Finite verb changes its forms as per the tense, the person and the number of the subject, but non-finite verbs do not. 

In the following sentences, 'like' is a finite verb and 'reading' is a non-finite verb.

He likes ***reading*** books. <br>
He liked ***reading*** books. (Finite verb changes with the tense of the subject) <br>
I like ***reading*** books. (Finite verb changes with the person of the subject) <br>
They like ***reading*** books. (Finite verb changes with the number of the subject)

In the following sentences, 'refuse' is a finite verb and ‘to obey’ is a non-finite verb.

He refuses ***to obey*** the instructions. <br>
He refused ***to obey*** the instructions. (Finite verb changes with the tense of the subject) <br>
I refuse ***to obey*** the instructions. (Finite verb changes with the person of the subject) <br>
They refuse ***to obey*** the instructions. (Finite verb changes with the number of the subject)


## Types of Non-Finite Verbs

There are three types of Non-Finite Verbs:

* Infinitive
* Gerund
* Participle

We will study all these three in separate articles in much more detail. But here, let us understand their basic properties and differences. 


## Properties of Non-Finite Verbs

### Property 1

Finite verbs can act as the main verb of a sentence or a clause, even when used alone. 

Lionel Messi ***plays*** football for Barcelona. (plays – finite verb as main verb)  

Non-finite verbs alone cannot act as the main verb of a sentence or a clause. Though when used with a helping verb to make a verb phrase, a non-finite verb may work as the main verb.    

Lionel Messi is ***playing*** football. (playing – non-finite verb as main verb; is – finite verb as helping verb)

The plan has been ***examined***. (examined – non-finite verb as main verb;  been – non-finite verb as helping verb; has – finite verb as helping verb)

### Property 2

A Non-finite verb may act as noun, adjective or adverb. 

Though Non-finite verbs show a few characteristics that verbs have (e.g. they can have an object and be modified by adverb) and some of them may even be part of verb phrases and even function as main verb in a sentence.

But they can function as other parts of speech too. 

* As a noun: <br>
***Swimming*** is a very good exercise. 

* As an adjective: <br>
The ***barking*** dog is hungry.

* As an adverb: <br>
He went to Harvard ***to study***. 

### Property 3

Certain finite and non-finite forms of a given verb are often identical.

They ***cry*** a lot. (cry - finite verb) <br>
They will ***cry*** a lot. (cry - non-finite infinitive)

Matthew ***tried*** to help. (tried - finite verb) <br>
Matthew has ***tried*** to help. (tried - non-finite participle)
