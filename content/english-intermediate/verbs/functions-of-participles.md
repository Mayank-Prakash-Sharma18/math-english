## Uses of Participles

Participles can be used to join sentences. 

Using present participle to join sentences:

I saw a lion. I climbed a tree. <br>
***Seeing*** a lion, I climbed a tree. (seeing – present participle)

I was hungry. I took food. <br> 
***Being*** hungry, I took food. (being – present participle)

Using perfect participle to join sentences:

She took rest. She started to do homework. <br>
***Having taken*** rest, she started to do homework. (having taken – perfect participle)

## Present participle Vs Past participle

Some words making participle adjectives can have both forms – present participle and past participle, i.e. they can have both –ing and -ed forms.

Their meanings might be very different, or not.

For example:

* breaking and broken: Their meanings are different. <br>
The ***breaking*** waves crashed against the rocks. <br> 
She's suffering from a ***broken*** heart. 

* falling and fallen: Their meanings are similar. <br>
The ***falling*** leaves covered the path. <br>
The ***fallen*** trees blocked the road. 

### Rule 1

To describe a person (or sometimes animal) or a thing that is the source of a feeling/emotion: <br>
Present participle (-ing adjective) is used to show the qualities or characteristics of a person, animal or thing, i.e. to describe the source of a feeling/emotion, e.g. interesting film, interesting man, exciting city, etc. 

He is ***interesting***. <br>
This movie is ***boring***. <br>
The dog is ***frightening***.

To showcase the feeling/emotion of a person (or sometimes animal): <br>
We use a Past participle (-ed adjective) to show a feeling or an emotion of a person or animal (generally for a short time period). 

He is ***interested*** in politics. <br>
I am ***bored*** of this movie. <br>
The dog is ***frightened***.

A thing can cause an emotion or feeling but can’t receive it. So, we do not use a past participle with a thing. <br>
This movie is bored/exited/frustrated. (incorrect – a movie cannot have emotions!)

Let’s see some more examples:

I am ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">interesting</span>*** in your proposal. (incorrect) <br>
I am ***<span class="mak-text-color">interested</span>*** in your proposal. (correct; the person is having the feeling)

{{% alert note %}}
Summary: 

We use Past Participle to describe how we feel and Present Participle to describe what caused the feelings.

Is the person / animal / thing the source of the feeling? – If yes, then use –ing form <br>
The cat is ***frightening***. 

Is the person / animal having the feeling? – If yes, then use –ed form <br>
The cat is ***frightened***.

I am interested because the movie is interesting. (interested – past participle; interesting - present participle; movie is causing the feeling/emotion)

### Rule 2

To showcase the work being done we use present participle. 

Everyone was sad in the ***losing*** team. - Team is the object  (prepositional object to be precise), and it is doing the work of losing, so we will use present participle here, i.e. losing. 

The children found the ***lost*** dog.  - Dog is the object and it is not doing the work of lost, someone else must have lost it. So, we will use past participle here, i.e. lost. 

### Rule 3

Present participle – we use it to tell about something that is happening at the same time we are speaking. <br>
The ***falling*** snow is beautiful.

Past participle – we use it to tell something that has happened before. <br>
The ***fallen*** snow is beautiful. 


## Meaning and Use of Participle Clauses

Participle Clauses give information about condition, reason, result or time.
	
* Condition <br>
We use participles in place of an 'if-condition'. <br>
***Looked*** after carefully, the horse will live long. (If you look after the horse carefully, it will live long.)
	
* Reason <br>
We use participles in place of words like 'so' or 'therefore'. <br>
***Wanting*** to speak, he cleared his throat and garnered courage. (He wanted to speak so he cleared his throat and garnered courage.)
	
* Time <br>
We use participles in place of words like 'when', 'while' or 'as soon as'. <br>
***Sitting*** at the table, I saw Scarlett Johnson sitting on a table next to me. (While I was sitting at the table, I saw Scarlett Johnson sitting on a table next to me.)


## Uses of Present participle

Present participle → $V_1$ + ing 

### Use Case 1

Present participle is used to combine two sentences when:

* The subject is common 
* Action – instant / interrupted / simultaneous  

Pattern: $V_1$ + ing + ......................., Subject + Verb + ..................

Walking across the road, Aanya met her teacher. (Subject - Aanya; Subject was walking and Subject met, i.e. Subject is common) 

Turning to the left, you will find the temple.

Reaching home, Hanumita had a bath and then cooked some food. 

Having reached home, Hanumita had a bath and then cooked some food. 

We use present participle when ***two actions are taking place at the same time by a single person***. In such cases we use present participle in the second action. 

He watched television while ***enjoying*** red wine. 

We also use present participle in case of ***two actions happening one after another, without any time gap*** (it shows fastness). In such cases we use present participle in the first action. 

***Seeing*** the police, the thief ran away. (It can also be written as - The thief ran away after seeing the police. But it does not reflect the fastness of the thief's action.)

### Use Case 2

Present participle is used to combine two sentences when: 

* The subject is not common. 
* Action – instant / interrupted/ simultaneous   

Pattern 1: While + Subject + Auxiliary Verb + $V_1$ + ing ........, + Subject  + Verb, ...... <br>
Pattern 2: While + $V_1$ + ing ........, Subject + Verb + .....

While reading the newspaper, the dog disturbed me. (ambiguous - here dog is not reading the newspaper) <br>
While I was reading the newspaper, the dog disturbed me. <br>
While reading the newspaper, I was disturbed by the dog.

Sleeping in my room, a thief entered and stole away everything. (ambiguous - here thief was not sleeping) <br>
While I was sleeping in my room, a thief entered and stole away everything. 

Strolling in the park, a dog bit Meenakshi. (ambiguous - here dog was not strolling) <br>
While Meenakshi was strolling in the park, a dog bit her. <br>
While strolling in the park, Meenakshi was bit by a dog.

### Use Case 3

Present participle is used to combine two sentences when:

* The subject is not common.
* Action – instant / interrupted / simultaneous (cause and effect) 

Pattern: Subject + $V_1$ + ing  ......., + Subject + Verb + ...... 

<!-- Being a teacher I advise you not to go there. (I – subject; I is the teacher and I advised too)  -->

Being Sunday, she decided to have some rest. (incorrect; here she is not Sunday, but she rested) <br>
As it was Sunday, she decided to have some rest. (correct) OR <br>
It being Sunday, she decided to have some rest. (correct)

As they were very expensive, I could not buy them. (correct) OR <br>
They being very expensive, I could not buy them. (correct)

### Use Case 4

After verbs of senses/perception, e.g. smell, hear, listen, look, see, watch, notice, observer, etc., we either use bare infinitive or present participle, but the meaning differs (bare infinitive refers to a completed action while present participle refers to an ongoing action). 

Pattern: verb + object + present participle

I saw her ***eat*** mangoes.  (eat – bare infinitive; indicates a completed action) <br>
I saw her ***eating*** mangoes. (eating - present participle; indicates an ongoing action)

### Use Case 5: catch and find

We use present participle with the verbs 'catch' and 'find' in the following manner. 

Pattern: verb + object + present participle

When used with 'catch', the present participle always refers to an action which causes annoyance or anger. While in case of 'find', it is unemotional.

If I ***catch you stealing*** my books again, I will definitely report. 

I ***caught her going*** through my purse.

We ***found her roaming*** in the corridors.


### Use Case 6: spend and waste

We use present participle with the verbs 'spend' and 'waste' in the following manner. 

Pattern: verb + time / money expression + present participle.

Anand ***spends ten hours a day studying*** for the exams.

We've ***spent the whole night gambling***.

Don't ***waste time watching*** ice hockey!

I ***wasted money buying*** this apartment.


## Uses of Past Participle

Past participles - represent a completed action

Exited by the news, he jumped up and down on the bed. <br>
(Exited by the news – describes a completed action; exited – non-finite verb, i.e. past participle $V_3$; jumped – finite verb)

In the above sentence ‘$V_3$’ shows an action already completed before the second action took place. The second action started after the first action and also as the result of the first action. 


## Uses of Perfect Participle

Perfect Participle → Having + (been) + $V_3$

### Use Case 1

Perfect participle is used to combine two sentences when: <br>
* The subject is common. <br>
* One action takes place after the completion of another. 

<!-- Pattern 1: Subject + having + (been) + $V_3$ +.............+ Verb + Object + ....... <br> -->
Pattern: Having + (been) + $V_3$ + ........ + Subject + Verb + Object

Having finished my homework, I went out to play.  

Having been arrested, the thief was sent to jail.

<!-- Having been cooked the food, I served it. <br> -->
Having cooked the food, I served it. 

Having been washed, the clothes were put out in the sun.

### Use Case 2

Perfect participle is used to combine two sentences when: <br>
* The subject is not common. <br>
* One action takes place after the completion of another (cause and effect) 

Pattern: Subject + having + $V_3$, + Subject + Verb 

The sun rose. The fog disappeared. <br>
Combined sentence - The sun having risen, the fog disappeared. 

The two businessmen have come to terms. Now the business will prosper. <br>
Combined sentence – The two businessmen having come to terms, now the business will prosper. 

### Use Case 3

Perfect participle means 'after completion of some action'. <br>
* Having + $V_3$ (active form) <br>
* Having been + $V_3$ (passive form)

Perfect participle is used when there are two actions and there is a time-gap between the two actions. We use Perfect participle for the first action. The second action starts only after the first action ends. 

***Having taken*** food, I went to bed. (having taken – perfect participle in active form) <br>
***Having been defeated***, they fled away. (having been defeated - perfect participle in passive form)

{{% alert note %}}
If the second work starts just after the first one without time-gap, then we use present participle, e.g. Seeing a snake, I ran away.
{{% /alert %}}

### Use Case 4

Perfect Participle is used in the following cases:

* when the first action has been going on for a period of time when the second action started. <br>
***Having worked*** there for more than two years, he didn’t want to switch jobs.

* some time had passed before the second action started. <br>
***Having been*** a good hockey player in my college days, I found it easier to learn the new dribbling moves.


## Errors in the Use of Participles

Participial phrases that don’t clearly have a noun to modify are known as dangling or misplaced modifiers. There’s a minute difference between them though. 

So, two very common mistakes in the use of participles are:

* Misplaced modifier – when there are two or more subjects in a sentence and we place the participle at the wrong place, making it unclear which subject it is modifying. 

* Dangling modifier – when the word/subject being modified isn't present in the sentence.

### Error 1: Misplaced modifiers 

Misplaced modifier – When it is not clear which subject the Participial phrase is modifying, then such Participial phrase is known as misplaced modifier. 

Participle is a verb-adjective and so it must be clear which noun or pronoun they are referring to, i.e. a proper 'subject of reference‘ should be there. We must put the participle phrase next to the word it's modifying. 

***Standing*** at the porch, a scorpion stung her. (ambiguous statement)

It is an ambiguous statement. It may mean two things depending on whom the participle is referring too. Who is standing? – scorpion or the girl? How can a scorpion possibly stand? Here ‘standing’ is a misplaced modifier. 

It’s clear that the writer wants to say that the girl was standing. So, to clarify it we need to rewrite the sentence such that the participle points to the right subject. 

***Standing*** at the porch, she was stung by a scorpion. (correct; the girl was standing, i.e. the participle ‘standing’ was modifying the noun ‘girl’, so we placed the ‘girl’ next to the participle phrase) <br>
Or: While she was ***standing*** at the porch, a scorpion stung him. (correct; the girl was standing)

{{% alert note %}}
Talking about misplaced modifiers in general, there are two kinds of misplaced modifiers:

#### Type 1: Classic misplaced modifier

Misplaced modifier could seem to modify a word that it should not, i.e. it modifies the wrong word. 

Coax the monkey ***with a banana***.  

Here, ’with a banana’ is a classic misplaced modifier. Does it modifies coax or monkey? Right now it seems to modify ‘monkey’. So, it means – coax the monkey that has a banana. What the writer actually wants to say (and it makes more sense) is that – coax the monkey by using a banana. So, a Classic misplaced modifier changes the meaning of the sentence from what the writer originally intended. 

#### Type 2: Squinting modifier

With Squinting modifier it is not clear whether it modifies the thing to its left or right. 

Whispering ***quickly*** annoys him.  

Here, ’quickly’ is a squinting modifier. ‘quickly’ modifies ‘Whispering’ or ‘annoys’? Does he gets annoyed when someone whispers quickly OR when someone whispers he gets annoyed quickly.  So, a Squinting modifier makes the sentence ambiguous. 

We should place our modifier next to whatever it's modifying, and as far away from other possible words that it may seem to modify and make the sentence ambiguous or meaningless.

### Error 2: Dangling modifiers 

Dangling modifier – when the word/subject being modified isn't present in the sentence, i.e. this modifier has nothing to modify. 

***Having read*** the novel, the movie will be a super hit. (‘having read the novel’ participle phrase modifies what?) <br>
***Having read*** the novel, I think the movie will be a super hit. (participle phrase modifies I)

We can also say that, we use Participle Clauses when the Participle and the Verb in the main clause have the same subject. If they have separate subjects then we need to mention both subjects, otherwise the participle clause/phrase will become a dangling modifier. 

***Being*** ill, we didn't go to school. (correct; ‘being’ and ‘didn’t go’ have the same subject ‘we’)

***Being*** a rainy day, we didn't go to school. (incorrect; ‘being’ and ‘didn’t go’ have different subjects and so we need to mention both) <br>
It ***being*** a rainy day, we didn't go to school. (correct)

***Driving*** on the highway, the baby began to cry. (incorrect; ‘driving’ and ‘began’ have different subjects and so we need to mention both) <br>
While I was ***driving*** on the highway, the baby began to cry. (correct) 

#### Impersonal Absolute

Not all dangling modifiers are wrong. 

Impersonal Absolute – It is a participle that is left without a proper 'subject of reference’ as the unexpressed subject is indefinite.

***Taking*** everything into account, this deal makes no sense. (Taking everything into account = If one takes everything into account; one – indefinite pronoun)

Roughly ***speaking***, the distance between the two towns is around 2000 kms. (Roughly speaking = If one speaks roughly; one – indefinite pronoun)

{{% alert note %}}
Sometimes, the subject is left without a participle. In such cases the participle is understood. Let’s see a few examples. 

Knife (***being***) in hand, he attacked the cop. (being – participle, he - subject)

Dinner (***being***) over, we went for a swim. (having been – participle, we - subject)
{{% /alert %}}


### Error 3

Though a participle phrase can work as an adverbial phrase, but sometimes rephrasing that participle adverbial phrase without the participle brings out the implied meaning more clearly. 

To express the implied meaning more clearly, we can change the participial phrase into: <br>
* a clause of time, <br>
* a clause of cause, <br>
* a clause of concession, or <br>
* a clause of condition. 

***Having completed*** his lunch, he went out to play basketball. (correct) OR <br>
***After*** he had completed his lunch, he went out to play basketball. (correct)

***Following*** my advice, you will make huge profits. (correct) OR <br>
***If*** you follow my advice, you will make huge profits. (correct)
