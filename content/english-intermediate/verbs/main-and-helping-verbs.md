## Main Verbs and Helping Verbs

Main verbs show the main action or state being focused to in the sentence. 

Helping verbs are the verbs that are used to help the main verb to express its meaning in accordance with tense, person, number, voice or mood. They do not have any meaning of their own. 

Helping verbs combine with a main verb to form a verb phrase. 

He ***is studying*** right now. (is - helping verb; studying - main verb)

He ***is watching*** the game. (is - helping verb; watching - main verb)

### Usage of Helping Verbs

* Can tell about tense: <br>
I ***am*** running. <br>
I ***was*** running.

* Can help us make negative sentences: <br>
He ***is not*** studying right now. <br>
***Do not*** go there all alone. 

* Can help us make questions: <br>
***Is*** he studying right now? <br>
***Have*** you taken your tiffin box? 


## Types of Helping Verbs

There are two major types of Helping Verbs:
* Auxiliary Verbs
* Modal Verbs - They are further classified into Pure modals, Semi-modals & Idiomatic modals

### Auxiliary Verbs

Auxiliary verbs – these are various forms of be, do and have

Auxiliary verbs can be used in a sentence as a helping verb, as well as the main verb. 

I ***am*** going to the gym. (am is a helping verb here) <br>
I ***am*** a trainer. (am is the main verb here)

I ***do*** know him. (do is a helping verb here) <br>
I did ***do*** that. (do is the main verb here)

I ***have*** to go to college now. (have is a helping verb here) <br>
I ***have*** a cat. (have is the main verb here)


#### Uses of Auxiliary Verbs

##### Use Case 1: Tense Formation

Auxiliary verbs (when they function as helping verbs) are the verbs that are used to help the main verb to express its meaning in accordance with tense. 

They ***are*** playing baseball. (present continuous tense) <br>
They ***were*** playing baseball. (past continuous tense) <br>
They ***have*** played baseball. (present perfect tense) <br>
They ***have been*** playing baseball since morning. (present perfect continuous tense)

##### Use Case 2

They are also used to make passive forms, questions and negatives.  

* Negatives <br>
He ***is not*** studying right now. 

* Questions <br>
***Is*** he studying right now? 


### Modal Verbs

Modal verbs are the verbs that are used to help the main verb to express its meaning in accordance with mood (and tense too). 

They are of two types: Pure Modal Verbs, and Semi Modal Verbs

<img src="../../../media/verbs/verbs-3.png" alt="verbs" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

They are also termed Defective Verbs, because some parts are wanting in them. 
* They have no -s in the third person singular.
* They have no ***ing*** and ***ed*** forms. 
* They do not have non-finite forms (participle or infinitive). That is, their forms do not change with subject, person or number.

#### Uses of Modal Verbs

Modal verbs – help the main verb to express its meaning in accordance with mood. 

* Possibility <br>
It ***may*** rain today. 

* Strong Possibility <br>
She ***must*** have left already. 

* Ability <br>
I ***can*** complete this task. 

* Permission <br>
You ***can*** go now. 

* Condition <br>
If it ***should*** rain, he will not come. 

Let's study about Pure Modal Verbs, Semi Modal Verbs, and Idiomatic modals in more detail. 

#### Pure Modal Verbs

Pure Modal verbs can only be used in a sentence as a helping verb (not as the main verb). 

The main verb following pure modal (except ought) must be in bare infinitive form (i.e. $V_1$ form). <br>
She ***can*** help you. (help - $V_1$) <br>
She ***should*** meet you friends. (meet - $V_1$)

#### Semi Modal Verbs

Used to, need and dare are called Semi Modal Verbs or Marginal Auxiliary Verbs.

These Semi-Modal verbs can be used in a sentence as a helping verb, as well as a main verb (Need & Dare) or as an adjective (used to) in a sentence.

I ***need*** you. (need - main verb) <br>
You ***need*** not come tomorrow. (need - helping verb; come - bare infinitive)

She does not ***dare*** to come home late. (dare - main verb; to come - infinitive) <br>
I ***dare*** not enter his room without permission. (dare - helping verb; enter - bare infinitive)

I am ***used to*** sleeping late at night. (am - helping verb; used to - Adjective; sleeping - Gerund)

'ought' and 'used' is always followed by Infinitive 'to + V1'

We ***ought*** to respect our parents. (to respect - to + $V_1$)

He ***used*** to come late. (to come - to + $V_1$)

#### Idiomatic modals

These are of 6 types. (we use these modals to give a specific advise) 

* Had better / Had rather/ Had sooner 

* Would better / Would rather / Would sooner

{{% alert note %}}
In helping verbs, except auxiliary verbs, all the other three (modals, marginal and idiomatic modals) are used to change the mood in a sentence.  

So, Modals are “Mood makers” and not “Sentence Makers”. There won’t be a grammatical error in a sentence even if modal is removed.

Different modal are used to express different moods. In the following sentences the modals (must, may) are changing the mood of the sentence. 

They ***have*** gone. <br>
They ***must have*** gone. <br>
They ***may have*** gone.
