## Objective or Possessive case before Gerund

We can use either the possessive case or objective case of nouns and pronouns before gerunds. The possessive form is more formal.

There is no possibility of ***me*** coming late. (correct; me – objective case) <br>
There is no possibility of ***my*** coming late. (correct: my – possessive case)

I resented ***Anand*** winning the competition. (correct; Anand – objective case) <br>
I resented ***Anand's*** winning the competition. (correct: Anand's – possessive case)

Saurabh recalled ***him*** borrowing the bike. (correct; him – objective case) <br>
Saurabh recalled ***his*** borrowing the bike. (correct: his – possessive case)

Some other verbs that can be followed by an object with a possessive case and then a gerund (-ing form) include:

* verbs of '(dis)liking' such as: detest, disapprove of, dislike, hate, like, love, object to, and 
* verbs of 'thinking' such as: envisage, forget, imagine, remember, think of.

We can only use a possessive form (my, Anand's, his) like this to talk about a person or a group of people:

I remembered the ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">horse’s</span>*** winning the race. (incorrect) <br>
I remembered the ***<span class="mak-text-color">horse</span>*** winning the race. (correct)


## Infinitive Vs. Gerund

### Concept 1

Both the Gerund and the Infinitive can work as a Noun and a Verb. So, they have many similar uses and are interchangeable in many sentences, i.e. we can use either of them without any special difference in meaning.

Teach me ***to bowl***. <br>
Teach me ***bowling***. 

***To give*** is better than ***to receive***. <br>
***Giving*** is better than ***receiving***.

### Concept 2

Some verbs are followed by gerunds, some verbs are followed by infinitives, and some verbs can be followed by either gerunds or infinitives. 

We will need to learn in detail which verb is followed by what. But before we do so, let’s get to know some tips that will make our task easier. 

#### Tip 1

In most cases a gerund will come after a preposition. An infinitive cannot be the object of a preposition, only a gerund can. 

He is afraid ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">of to box</span>***. (incorrect; of – preposition; to box - infinitive) <br>
He is afraid ***<span class="mak-text-color">of boxing</span>***. (correct; of – preposition; boxing - gerund) <br>
He is afraid ***<span class="mak-text-color">to box</span>***. (correct; to box – infinitive; here we dropped the preposition)

#### Tip 2

To talk about an activity, we generally use a gerund. 

He stopped ***drinking***.

To describe many activities we use the following pattern.

Pattern: go + gerund

Let’s go ***skiing***. <br>
We went ***shopping***.


### Concept 3: Verbs followed by either Gerund or Infinitive

Some verbs can be followed by either Gerund or Infinitive. But the meaning of the sentence may or may not differ in the two cases. 

#### Type 1: Meaning of the sentence will remain the same

Some verbs can be followed by either Gerund or Infinitive. The meaning of the sentence will remain the same. 

<img src="../../../media/verbs/verbs-12.png" alt="verbs" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

Some other such verbs are: like, neglect, prefer, propose, remember

{{% alert note %}}
However, with these verbs we normally avoid using two -ing forms together, as a repeated pattern can sound awkward.

I'm starting ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">learning</span>*** Gujrati. (incorrect) <br>
I'm starting ***<span class="mak-text-color">to learn</span>*** Gujrati. (correct) 
{{% /alert %}}

##### begin and start

They can be followed by Gerund or to-infinitive form with no difference in meaning.

I ***began to play*** Mario. <br>
I ***began playing*** Mario.

She ***started to look*** for a new job. <br>
She ***started looking*** for a new job.

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- {{% alert note %}}
**Exception 1:**

After progressive forms of 'begin' and 'start' infinitives are preferred (to avoid using two -ing forms together). 

I'm ***starting to use*** it now.

**Exception 2:**

In case of ‘understand, realise and know’, we use the infinitive form after 'begin' and start'. 

She ***began to realise*** her mistakes but there was nothing she could do then. <br>
She ***started to know*** the consequences of her actions after she got a taste of her own medicine.

##### like, love, hate and prefer

They can be followed by Gerund or to-infinitive form with no difference in meaning.

I ***love to take*** a nap in the afternoon. <br>
I ***love taking*** a nap in the afternoon.

Children ***enjoy to watch*** cartoons. <br>
Children ***enjoy watching*** cartoons. 

{{% alert note %}}
**Exception:**

But after would + like / prefer / love / hate, infinitives are preferred. 

I ***would like to meet*** the chef. <br>
I ***would love to drive*** for you.
{{% /alert %}}

##### sorry

Sorry for/about + gerund – Refers to past things that one regrets. <br>
I am sorry for keeping your application pending for such a long time.

Sorry + perfect infinitive (more formal) can be used with the same meaning. <br>
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

##### advise and encourage

These verbs are followed by gerund when there is no object and to-infinitive when there is one. 

I'd advise ***doing*** more exercise. (correct) <br>
I'd advise ***you to do*** more exercise. (correct; you - object)

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- ##### request, advise, order, allow, permit and forbid

If these verbs are followed immediately by an object, a to-infinitive is used otherwise gerund will follow.

We ***prohibit smoking*** here. <br>
We ***prohibit*** people ***to smoke*** here. (people - object)

I wouldn't ***advise taking*** the car to Noida. <br>
I wouldn't ***advise*** anyone ***to take*** the car to Noida. (anyone - object)

Meenakshi advised me ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">waking</span>*** up early in the morning. (incorrect) <br>
Meenakshi advised me ***<span class="mak-text-color">to wake</span>*** up early in the morning. (correct)

He requested ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">to keep</span>*** quite in the class. (incorrect) <br>
He requested ***<span class="mak-text-color">keeping</span>*** quite in the class. (correct) -->

##### remember, regret, forget 

If Remember / Regret / Forget denote the first action then the second action will be denoted by to-infinitive. <br> 
On the other hand, if Remember / Regret / Forget denote the second action then the first action will be denoted by a Gerund. 

Remember / Regret / Forget (First action)  + [To + $V_1$]  (Second action) <br>
Remember/ Regret / Forget (Second action) + [$V_1$ + ing] (First action) 

I remember (second action) ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">to meet</span>*** (first action) you a few years ago. (incorrect) <br>
I remember (second action) ***<span class="mak-text-color">meeting</span>*** (first action) you a few years ago. (correct)

I regret (second action) ***reprimanding*** (first action) your children last night. (correct)


#### Type 2: Meaning of the sentence may change

Some other verbs can be followed by either a to-infinitive or a gerund, but the meaning of the sentence may change. 

<img src="../../../media/verbs/verbs-13.png" alt="verbs" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

##### Verbs of perception

With many verbs of perception (e.g. feel, hear, notice, observe, overhear, see, watch, etc.) too, we can use either a to-infinitive or a gerund, but the meaning of the sentence may change.

In fact, there are two ways in which the meaning of a sentence may change, when verbs of perception are involved. 

###### Change 1: Action happened Once or Repeated

When these verbs are followed by a bare infinitive, it suggests that the action happened only once. <br>
I ***noticed*** him throw a wrapper on the floor. (throw – bare infinitive)

When these verbs are followed by a gerund, it suggests that the action was repeated or happened over a period of time. <br>
I ***heard*** those dogs barking most of the night. (barking – gerund)

###### Change 2: Action observed Completely or Partially

When these verbs are followed by a bare infinitive, it suggests that we watched, heard, etc. the whole action from its start to its finish ('complete events or actions' which are seen or heard from beginning to end).

I ***watched*** him climb through the window. (climb – bare infinitive) <br>
I ***saw*** the old man cross the road and disappear in the moor. (cross - bare infinitive)

When these verbs are followed by a gerund, it suggests that we watched, heard, etc. some of the action, but not from start to finish (i.e. one pays attention to 'events' or 'actions' that are already going on).

I was able to ***watch*** them building the new car park from my office window. (building – gerund) <br>
I ***saw*** the old man crossing the road. (crossing – gerund)

<!-- ### Concept 5: Phrases and Expressions followed by Gerund and not infinitive

We use a gerund (rather than an infinitive) after some phrases and expressions. Let’s see some of them. 

We use a Gerund (rather than an infinitive) after:

* Prepositions (including Verb phrases or Adjective phrases, i.e. certain verbs and adjectives followed by a preposition)

* Certain expressions ending in a preposition (e.g. in spite of, there's no point in etc.) -->


#### Verb phrases and Adjective phrases followed by Gerund and not Infinitive

##### Concept 1

We mostly use gerunds after prepositions (with some exceptions). Prepositions can come after any word - a noun, a pronoun, a verb or an adjective. 

A preposition that follows a noun: <br>
Stories ***about growing up*** are popular among youngsters. (about - preposition) <br>
We have an interest ***in becoming*** members of this club. (in - preposition)

A preposition that follows a pronoun: <br>
You will be punished ***for not telling*** the truth. (for - preposition) <br>
I talked him out ***of taking*** that cab. (of - preposition)

{{% alert note %}}
**Exception:**

‘but’ can work as a conjunction or a preposition. When ‘but’ works as a preposition, it means ‘except’.

If ‘but’ or ‘except’ are used like this, we use an infinitive after them (and not a gerund). 

I had no choice ***but to help*** them. (but - preposition) <br>
Mark made no attempts to woo her back ***except to call*** her once. (except - preposition)
{{% /alert %}}

##### Concept 2

Some verb and adjective phrases are also followed by a Gerund. 

At last we ***succeeded in accomplishing*** this mission. <br>
Are you ***interested in reading*** Gita?

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- ##### Concept 3

Some phrases have ‘to’ in them and they are followed by Gerund. 

Here ‘to’ is not a part of infinitive, but that of preposition. The gerund that comes after the preposition ‘to’ is the object of that preposition. 

In other words, after all the prepositions (including 'to'), if a verb comes, the verb generally has to be '$V_1$ + ing'.

She went back to playing for Bayern club. (to – preposition; playing – gerund as the object of the preposition ‘to’)

{{% alert note %}}
If verb comes before 'used to‘, gerund ($V_1$ + ing) comes after ‘used to’. That is, we use gerund after ‘Verb + used to’. It denotes a habit. It can be used in any tense. The verb that precedes 'used to' determines the tense of the sentence.

He got used to ***driving­­*** on the right when he was in London. (driving - gerund)

If verb does not come before 'used to', then '$V_1$' comes after ‘used to’. It denotes a routine action of past. It can be used only in Past tense.

I used to ***drive*** on the right. (drive – $V_1$)
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert note %}}
You will encounter ‘to’ in three forms. You should take care not to get confused between these. 

* Preposition ‘to’ 
* To-infinitive form,
* Auxiliary form (e.g. have to, used to, going to)

He went back to reading his novel. (to – preposition; reading – gerund as the object of the preposition ‘to’) <br>
I want to go home. (want – verb; to go – to-infinitive) <br>
I used to live in Japan. (used to – auxiliary verb; live - main verb)

###### go and go out

Pattern 1: go + Gerund <br>
Pattern 2: go out (for) + Gerund

Gerund → should be recreational/sports related, e.g. riding, hunting, swimming, skating, skiing, climbing, sailing, fishing, shopping, hitch-hiking

Whenever these words will come after ‘go’, then they will come in "ing" form (i.e. as Gerund), without preposition. 

<!-- But with ‘go out’, we use prepositions.  -->

I have decided to go ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">for</span>*** hitch-hiking tomorrow. (incorrect) <br>
I have decided to go hitch-hiking tomorrow. (correct)

Let’s go ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">for</span>*** shopping tonight. (incorrect) <br>
Let’s go shopping tonight. (correct)

<!-- I would like to go out for riding. (correct) -->

### Concept 6: Verbs followed by Infinitive and not Gerund

#### Concept 1

Some verbs are followed by a to-infinitive but not a gerund. Sometimes, they take a noun/pronoun (direct object) before the to-infinitive. 

Pattern 1: Verb + to-infinitive 

Such verbs are: afford, agree, appear, arrange, ask, begin, care, continue, decide, demand, expect, fail, forget, hesitate, hope, learn, manage, mean, offer, plan, prepare, pretend, promise, refuse, remember, seem, stop, volunteer, wait, want, wish

We offered ***to pay*** for the dinner.

He promised ***to return***.

Pattern 2: Verb + Noun/Pronoun (direct object) + to-infinitive

Such verbs are: advise, allow, ask, cause, challenge, command, convince, encourage, expect, forbid, force, hire, instruct, intend, invite, order, pay, permit, persuade, program, remind, teach, tell, urge, want, warn

Also, would like/love, would prefer

He encouraged his juniors ***to revolt*** against the management. (his juniors - pronoun)

Remind me ***to give*** Mragank a call. (me - pronoun)

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- Now, there are certain verbs that use either pattern, i.e. they may take a direct object before to-infinite or not. 

Some of such verbs are: ask, expect, (would) like, want, need

I asked ***to call*** the police. <br>
I asked him ***to call*** the police. (him – pronoun as direct object)

Julia expected ***to win***. <br>
Julia expected her team ***to win***. (her team – pronoun as direct object)

Mayank likes ***to bowl*** fast. <br>
Mayank likes his bowlers ***to bowl*** fast. (his bowlers – pronoun as direct object) -->

#### Concept 2

Apart from some verbs, infinitives are also used after many adjectives. When we describe something with an adjective we should use an infinitive (rather than a gerund).

It is not ***easy to play*** for Bayern Munich. (easy - adjective) <br>
It is ***necessary to speak*** in a humble tone with customers. (necessary - adjective)

<!-- Some other such adjectives: wonderful, …… add more adjectives  -->

{{% alert note %}}
If we want to convert object of to-infinitive into a subject, we should use a gerund:

***Playing*** for Bayern Munich is not easy.

***Speaking*** in a humble tone with customers is necessary.
