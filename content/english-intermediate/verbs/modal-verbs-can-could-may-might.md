In this article we are going to study about the Modal Verbs 'can, could, may, might'. 

We often use ‘can’, ‘could’, ‘may’ and ‘might’ in many similar situations. 

‘could’ and ‘might’ are used as the past equivalents of ‘can’ and ‘may’.

We can also use ‘could’ and ‘might’ for present times. In present-time contexts ‘could’ and ‘might’ are used as less positive versions of ‘can’ and ‘may’.

I ***could*** buy a Harley. (Less positive and more hesitant than 'I can buy a Harley.') <br>
***Might/Could*** I borrow your bike? (A diffident way of saying '***May/Can*** I ...') <br>
It ***might*** snow tonight. (Less positive than 'It ***may*** snow ...’)


## Uses of Can, Could, May, Might

### Use Case 1: Ability or Capacity

#### Concept 1

Using ‘can’ and ‘could’ we denote ability or capacity. 

That is, we can use can, can't (or cannot) (for the present) or could, couldn't (for the past) when we want to say that someone or something has or doesn't have the ability or capacity to do something, 

He ***can*** run pretty complex database queries. 

We ***can't*** afford any goof-ups.

Sheldon ***could*** solve calculus problems before he was six.

#### Concept 2: be able to 

We can also use ‘be able to’ instead of ‘can/could’ to talk about an ability that someone has or had.

Sachin ***can / is able*** to bat well, even though he's only 14.

He ***could / was able to*** run even though he had hamstring injury.

{{% alert note %}}
Both ‘be able to' and 'could/can' show capacity. Hence, we do not use them together in a sentence, otherwise the sentence will become superfluous.

Superfluous means ‘exceeding what is sufficient or necessary’, i.e. unnecessary or not needed.

I ***cannot be able to*** play tomorrow. (superfluous sentence) <br>
I ***cannot*** play tomorrow. (correct) <br>
I will not ***be able to*** play tomorrow. (correct)

Now, let us see the cases where we prefer one over the other. That is, can/could Vs.  

##### can/could Vs. be able to (With reference to general ability and specific achievement)

In general, we prefer using ‘can/could’ when talking about a general ability. <br>
But we prefer using ‘be able to’ when talking about a specific achievement (particularly if it is difficult, requiring some effort)

<!-- {{% alert note %}}
**Exceptions**:

With some verbs we commonly use ‘can’ and ‘could’, even when we are talking about specific occasions.

Such verbs are: <br>
Verbs of the senses, feel, hear, see, smell, taste, and <br>
Verbs of 'thinking', e.g. believe, decide, remember, understand.

She ***could feel*** the scorching heat as she crawled through the corridor of the burning building.

I ***can't decide*** where to go for my dinner. 
{{% /alert %}} -->

##### could Vs. be able to (With reference to general ability and performance)

Sometimes there’s a subtle difference between having the ability to do something and then actually doing it. 

###### In affirmative past sentences

‘Could’ expresses only ability to do an act, but not the performance of an act. 

I ***could*** hit long sixes when I was young. 

But ‘was/were able to’ expresses both the ability and the action.

When the boat hit the iceberg, we ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">could</span>*** swim to the bank. (incorrect) <br>
When the boat hit the iceberg, we ***<span class="mak-text-color">were able to</span>*** (or ***<span class="mak-text-color">managed to</span>***) swim to the bank. (correct)

###### In negative past sentences

Here we can use either ‘could’ or ‘was/were able to’.

I ***couldn't*** clear the exam. It was beyond my wits. (correct) <br>
I ***wasn't able to*** clear the exam. It was beyond my wits. (correct)


##### can Vs. be able to (With reference to present and future time)

###### Concept 1

We don't use ‘be able to’ when we talk about something that is happening as we are speaking:  

You have been working on this engine for long. Do you need some help? – Don’t bother me, I ***can*** do it. 

###### Concept 2

To say that something will be possible in the future, we use ‘will be able to’ (rather than ‘can’):

Once this bridge is built, we ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">can</span>*** drive to work in under an hour. (incorrect) <br>
Once this bridge is built, we ***<span class="mak-text-color">will be able to</span>*** drive to work in under an hour. (correct)

{{% alert note %}}
**Exception**

When we make a decision now about something in the future, we use ‘can’ (rather than ‘will be able to’):

You ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">will be able to</span>*** go home when you have completed the infographics. (incorrect) <br>
You ***<span class="mak-text-color">can</span>*** go home when you have completed the infographics. (correct; you may notice that it sounds more like permission, then ability)
{{% /alert %}}


##### can Vs. be able to (With reference to participle, gerund and infinitive)

###### Concept 1

We don't use ‘be able to’ before ‘be + past participle’:

This game ***can be played*** by anyone, with just a joystick.

###### Concept 2

We use ‘be able to’ (rather than can or could), if the idea we want to express needs a to-infinitive, an –ing form, or a perfect tense, or if it follows another modal verb:

We were very lucky ***to be able to live*** in India during the 80’s. (to live – to-infinitive)

The fact that I was not ***being able to talk*** to you, was the most difficult part.

Since his neck injury last year, he ***has not been able to perform*** well.

We ***may be able to do*** something about your predicament.


### Use Case 2: Permission

#### Concept 1

To ask permission to do something we use ‘can’ or ‘could’. We can also use them to give/refuse permission.

***Can/Could*** I take another break?

Okay. You ***can*** go out. 		

No, you ***can't*** go out with him.

{{% alert note %}}
We use ‘could’ while asking permission, to be particularly polite.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Concept 2

If we want to put extra pressure on someone to give a positive answer we can use can't or couldn't. For example, you might use couldn't where you expect that the answer is likely to be 'no', or where permission has been refused before.

***Can't/Couldn't*** we play just a little bit longer? Please?

#### Concept 3

To give or refuse permission, we prefer can/can't rather than could/couldn't.

No, you ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">couldn't</span>*** borrow the jacket today. (incorrect) <br>
No, you ***<span class="mak-text-color">can't</span>*** borrow the jacket today. (correct)

{{% alert note %}}
‘may’ and ‘may not’ are also used to ask for and give/refuse permission, but it’s considered rather formal.

***Can/May*** I borrow your bike?

You ***can/may*** go now.

Might can also be used to ask for permission.

***Might*** I ask what your plan is?
{{% /alert %}}

#### Concept 4: General permission Vs. Permission for one particular action

##### In Positive Sentences

To report that in the past someone had general permission to do (to do something at any time) → we can use either ‘could’ or ‘was/were allowed to’. 

In 1983, women ***were allowed to*** vote. (correct) <br>
In 1983, women ***could*** vote. (correct)

However, to report permission for one particular past action → we use ‘was/were allowed to’ (not ‘could’)

Although she didn't have a pass, Jennifer ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">could</span>*** come in. (incorrect) <br>
Although she didn't have a pass, Jennifer ***<span class="mak-text-color">was allowed to</span>*** come in. (correct)

##### In Negative Sentences

In negative sentences, to report that permission was not given, we can use either ***couldn't*** or ***wasn't/weren't allowed to*** (both in general or in particular situations)

In 1950s, women ***were not allowed to*** vote. (correct) <br>
In 1950s, women ***couldn't*** vote. (correct)

We ***couldn't / weren't allowed to*** attend the school until month-end.

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- #### Concept 5

If we use the present perfect, past perfect or an infinitive, we use ‘be allowed to’, not ‘can/could’.

He is unlikely ***to be allowed to*** enter Brisbane again.

They ***have been allowed to*** keep the treasure they found in their caves. -->


### Use Case 3: Offer

#### Concept 1

When we offer to do something in two ways:
* direct offer or 
* offer by making a suggestion

We can use ‘can’ or ‘could’ in both the cases.

***Can/Could*** I help you with your luggage? 	

You ***can/could*** borrow my pen if you want.

#### Concept 2

We can also use ‘shall’ and ‘should’ to give an offer. We use them in following scenarios:

* In offers that are questions. <br>
***Shall/Should*** I call a cab for you? (offer given)

{{% alert note %}}
If we use ***could*** or ***should***, we sound less certain that the offer will be accepted.
{{% /alert %}}

* In questions that request confirmation or advice. <br>
***Shall/Should*** I serve your main course? (confirmation seeked) <br>
Who ***shall/should*** I call? (advice seeked)

#### Concept 3

We can also use ‘would’ to give an offer. We use it in following scenarios:

* To make an offer, we can use ‘would (you) like’ (but not ‘will...‘) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Will you like</span>*** me to get you some coffee? (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Would you like</span>*** me to get you some coffee? (correct)

* To make a request, we can say ‘I would like’ (but not 'I will’) <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">will like</span>*** an apple juice. (incorrect) <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color">would like</span>*** an apple juice. (correct)

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- {{% alert note %}}
We can also use ***should*** (with I or we) instead of ***would*** in requests like this, but this is formal.
{{% /alert %}}

However, compare these ways of offering food and drink, and notice the difference:

What ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">will you like</span>*** to eat/drink? (incorrect) <br>
What ***<span class="mak-text-color">would you like</span>*** to eat/drink? (correct)

What ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">would you have</span>*** to eat/drink? (incorrect) <br>
What ***<span class="mak-text-color">will you have</span>*** to eat/drink? (correct) -->


### Use Case 4: Request

#### Concept 1

For friendly request, we use ‘can’. While for formal request, we use ‘could’.

***Can*** I take your pen? <br>
***Could*** I talk to the manager, please?

To make a request with authority → We use ‘can’ <br>
To make a polite request → We use ‘could’

***Could*** you please keep mum?

{{% alert note %}}
Past tense (could/might/would…) will make anything sound polite. 
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert note %}}
When 'May', shows respect/request, it is always used in interrogative form.

'***May***' I come in?
{{% /alert %}}


### Use Case 5: Possibility

#### Concept 1

Let us first of all consider the Affirmative sentences.

To say there is a possibility of something happening or being true → We generally use ‘may’ or ‘might’ in affirmative sentences.

This ***may/might*** be his last major speech before the election.

The news ***may/might*** come as a shock to many of the people present.

When Frank gets a job, I ***may/might*** get the money back that I lent him.

{{% alert note %}}
Whether we use ‘may’ or ‘might’, there is often little difference in meaning. But ‘might’ can suggest that there is less possibility.

‘Must’ shows greater possibility.

Tony Stark invented this micro nuclear reactor in a cave. He ***must*** be a genius.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Concept 2

To express possibility, we can also use ‘could’ (but not ‘can’), instead of may/might.

Aanya is absent today. It ***may/might/could*** be because she’s ill.

There ***may/might/could*** be some tokens left. 

{{% alert note %}}
If we are unsure about an opinion that we are giving → We prefer ‘could’ (over may/might)
{{% /alert %}}

#### Concept 3

We can also use ‘can’ in some affirmative sentences, especially when we talk about a more general possibility (rather than the possibility of something happening in a particular situation)

The temperature in Sahara desert ***can*** sometimes reach 50°C in summer time. (general possibility)

Roses ***can*** be white or red. (general possibility)

An idea ***can*** change your life. (general possibility)

It ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">can</span>*** snow tonight. (incorrect; here we are talking about the possibility in a very particular situation) <br>
It ***<span class="mak-text-color">may/might/could</span>*** snow tonight. (correct)

{{% alert note %}}
In more formal contexts we prefer may (rather than can).

Exceeding the stated dose ***may*** cause serious side effects. 
{{% /alert %}}


#### Concept 4: Words commonly used after may, might, could and can 

There are some words that we often use with may, might, could and can.

##### Well

We often use ‘may well, might well or could well’ to say that something is likely in the future.

The revenue of the company ***may/might/could well*** reach 50 million this quarter.

We don't use ‘can well’ in this way to talk about the future. However, ‘can well’ is used to talk about something we think or feel now.

I ***can well*** recall how I felt when she left me. 

##### Conceivably and Possibly

The President ***may conceivably*** impose an emergency soon. (= it is possible to believe it)

The new environmental laws ***could possibly*** lead to cleaner air in our cities.

{{% alert note %}}
We never use ‘possibly/likely’ with ***may***.

She ***may possibly*** play tomorrow. (this sentence is superfluous) <br>
She ***may*** play tomorrow. (correct) <br>
She will ***possibly*** play tomorrow. (correct)
{{% /alert %}}


#### Concept 5

Now let us consider the Interrogative and Negative sentences.

To say there is a possibility of something happening or being true → We use ‘can’ and ‘could’ in interrogative and negative sentences (just as 'may' is used to express possibility in affirmative sentences).

Let us consider Negative sentences first.

In negative sentences (including sentences with words like only, hardly or never), we use ‘can not’ and ‘could not’, to say that something is not possible.

{{% alert note %}}
We can also use their contracted form, i.e. can't or couldn't, but they are considered a bit less formal. 
{{% /alert %}}

It ***may*** rain tomorrow. (affirmative sentence) <br>
It ***cannot*** be true. (negative sentence)

There ***can't/couldn't*** be any bugs left in the code.

There ***can/could*** hardly be any doubt that the ball was tampered with.


#### Concept 6: may not / might not Vs. can not / could not 

We use ***may not or might not*** to say that it is possible that something is not true, i.e. they denote improbability.

We use ***can't or couldn't*** to say that it is not possible that something is true, i.e. they denote impossibility.

Compare the use of ‘may/might’ and ‘can/could’ in negative sentences:

There are plans to construct a new metro line, but it ***may not / might not*** happen for another few years. (= It is possible that it won't happen for another few years.)

There are plans to construct a new metro line, but it ***can't/couldn't*** happen for another few years. (= It is not possible that it will happen for another few years.)

#### Concept 7

Let us consider Interrogative sentences now.

In interrogative sentences (to ask about the possibility of something happening), we use ‘can’ and ‘could’.

***Can*** this be true? (interrogative sentence)

***Could*** it be that you don't want to leave?

We can also use phrases like, ‘be likely’. <br>
***Is*** he ***likely*** to propose her in near future?

We can even use ‘might’ in these types of questions, but it is considered rather formal: <br>
***Might*** the board of directors be persuaded to change their votes?

{{% alert note %}}
We don't use ‘may’ to ask questions about the possibility of something happening.
{{% /alert %}}

 
#### Concept 8: may, might, can and could with participle, infinitive and -ing

To talk about a possibility in the past or future, we can use ‘can, could, may and might’ with:

* past participle,
* infinitive and 
* -ing

Let's study them one by one. 

##### Use of may, might, can and could with past participle

###### To talk about a possibility in the present 

She is not there. Where ***can*** she ***have gone***? (i.e. Where is it possible that she has gone? – Use of 'may' instead of 'can' would have expressed annoyance.) 

###### To talk about a possibility in the past 

We use ‘could, may and might’ (not ‘can’) with past participle to talk about a possibility in the past.

* To say that it is possible that something happened in the past → We use ‘may/might/could (not 'can') + have + past participle’ <br><br>
Where is Anand’s bike? - He ***may/might/could have taken*** it with him. <br>
I thought John is the robber, but I ***may/might/could have been*** wrong.

* To say that something was possible in the past, but it did not happen → We use ‘might/could (not 'may' or 'can') + have + past participle’ <br><br>
The launch ***might/could*** easily ***have gone*** wrong, but the ISRO scientists resolved a major bug in the system at the eleventh hour. <br>
If police would not have recovered the missing CCTV footage, then Anand ***might/could have been*** the one arrested instead of the real robber.

###### To talk about a possibility in the future 

We use ‘may and might’ with past participle to talk about a possibility in the future.

To say that by some time in the future, it is possible that something will have happened → We use ‘may/might (not 'can') + have + past participle’ 

By next Saturday I ***may/might have created*** the required motion graphic.

Could can also be used in the same pattern to talk about a future possibility (instead of may or might). We do so when we want to show that we are unsure about the possibility.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert note %}}
We can use some words like well/conceivably/possibly in such structures (to talk about past or future possibility).

That is, may/might/could + well/conceivably/possibly + have + past participle 

But we don't use 'can + well/conceivably/possibly + have + past participle)
{{% /alert %}} -->


##### Use of may, might, can and could with infinitive

We use ‘might’ with infinitive to talk about a possibility in the past.

To talk about what was typically the case in the past → We use ‘might (not 'may') + infinitive’ 

During emergency, the police ***might arrest*** you for speaking against the government.

Before 1900s, slaves ***might be*** bought and sold in the middle-west in open markets. (passive form)

{{% alert note %}}
We can also use ‘could + infinitive’ to talk about past ability (rather than past possibility).

{{% /alert %}}


##### Use of may, might, can and could with -ing

To say it is possible that something is happening now or to talk about a possible future arrangement → We use ‘may/might (not 'can') + be + -ing’

Could can also be used in the same pattern (instead of may or might). We do so when we want to show that we are unsure about the possibility.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert note %}}
We can combine past participle and –ing to talk about possible situations or activities that went on over a period of time until now.

There are no bugs left in the software. I guess Mayank ***might have been working*** on it. (i.e. from a past time until now)
{{% /alert %}} -->


### Use Case 6: Wish

‘may’ is used to express a wish/blessing/pray (in formal English).

***May*** you succeed! (wish/blessing) <br>
***May*** you live long! (wish/blessing)

‘may’ can also be used for curse.

***May*** enemies of our country die. (curse)


### Use Case 7: Reproach

Might is used to express a degree of dissatisfaction or reproach.

You ***might*** pay a little more attention to your studies.


### Use Case 8

If Principal clause is in present tense, then we often use 'may' in subordinate clause.

Such a subordinate clause denotes a purpose and starts with ‘that/so that/in order that’.

We work so that we ***may*** earn.
