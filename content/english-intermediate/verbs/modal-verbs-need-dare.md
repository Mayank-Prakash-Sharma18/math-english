In this article we are going to study about the Modal Verbs 'need, and dare'. 

## Need and Dare 

Need expresses requirement, necessity or obligation.

Dare expresses challenges or courage.

‘dare' and 'need' can be used both as 'main verb' and as ‘helping modal verb'.

He ***needs*** this medicine. (needs – working as main verb) <br>
You ***need*** not study today. (need – working as modal verb; study – main verb)

He does not ***dare*** to go there. (dare – working as main verb) <br>
I ***dare*** not challenge him. (dare – working as modal verb; challenge – main verb)

#### In sentences with positive sense

need/dare generally function as main verb (rather than as a modal) and to  + $V_1$ comes after them.

We ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">need talk</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
We ***<span class="mak-text-color">need to talk</span>***. (correct; need – main verb) 

#### In sentences with negative sense

'need/dare not' are followed by a bare infinitive (i.e. only '$V_1$' and not 'to + $V_1$‘).

You ***need not*** come tomorrow. <br>
He ***dare not*** come here again.

In other cases, they may also be followed by to-infinitive. 

He will not ***dare*** to compete with me. (correct)

## Need and Dare with/without do

The modal verb ‘need’ can be used with or without ‘do’. 

### ‘need’ without ‘do’

When used without do, it has no -s and -ed forms.

In such a case, it is used with bare infinitive in negative sentences, sentences that contain semi-negative words like 'scarcely' and 'hardly‘ and in interrogative sentences.

She ***need*** not leave. (negative sentence) <br>
***Need*** I fire him? (interrogative sentence) <br>
I scarcely ***need*** his help. (sentence with a semi-negative work)

### ‘need’ with ‘do’

When used with do, it has the usual forms needs, needed.

In such a case, it is used with to-infinitive in negative sentences, and in interrogative sentences.

I ***don't need*** to pay him. (negative sentence) <br>
Do you ***need*** to eat now? (interrogative sentence)

As already mentioned, we use ‘need’ with to-infinitive in affirmative sentences too (without use of 'do'). 

One ***needs*** to be risk-aversive. (affirmative sentence)
{{% /alert %}}

### ‘dare’ without ‘do’

When used without 'do', dare is followed by bare infinitive (an infinitive without 'to')

He ***dare*** not lie. (lie – bare infinitive)

### ‘dare’ with ‘do’

When used with do, dare takes an infinitive (with or without to) after it.

He ***doesn't dare*** lie to me. (lie – bare infinitive) <br>
What if he ***does dare*** to lie? (to lie – to-infinitive)


## Uses of Need and Dare 

### Concept 1: must not Vs. need not

To say that something is not allowed → We use mustn't <br>
To say that something is not necessary → We use needn't (or don't need to) or don't have to 

You ***mustn't*** play inside the house. (it’s not allowed) <br>
You ***needn't*** play inside the house, when you have such a large garden. (it’s not necessary) <br>
You ***don’t need to*** play inside the house, when you have such a large garden. (it’s not necessary) <br>
You ***don’t have to*** play inside the house, when you have such a large garden. (it’s not necessary)

### Concept 2: needn't Vs. don't need to

So, we know that to say that something is not necessary, we use needn't or don't need to.  But there are some minute differences in their use cases. Let’s see. 

To give permission not to do something → We can use either needn't or don't need to

You ***don't need to*** paint the wall today. You can do it tomorrow. (correct) <br>
You ***needn't*** paint the wall today. You can do it tomorrow. (correct)

But to talk about a general necessity → We prefer don't need to (rather than needn't)

You ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">needn't</span>*** be over 21 to get married. (incorrect) <br>
You ***<span class="mak-text-color">don't need to</span>*** be over 21 to get married. (correct)

### Concept 3: didn't need to / didn't have to Vs. need not have

To say that it was not necessary to do something in the past, and it wasn't done → We use didn't need to or didn't have to. 

To say that something that was done in the past, was not necessary → We use need not have

Compare the following sentences:

My boss told me that he couldn't come for dinner, so I ***didn't need/have to cook*** dinner. (i.e. I didn't cook the dinner) <br>
I ***needn't have cooked*** dinner. My boss called to say that he couldn't come to eat. (i.e. I cooked the dinner)

We ***didn't need to*** do it. (i.e. it was not necessary for us to do it, and we didn't do it.) <br>
We ***needn't have*** done it. (i.e. it was not necessary for us to do it, but we did it.)
