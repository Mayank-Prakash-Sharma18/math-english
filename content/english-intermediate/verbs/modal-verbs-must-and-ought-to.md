In this article we are going to study about the Modal Verbs 'must and ought to'. 


## Uses of Must and Ought to 

### Use Case 1: Necessity or Obligation 

#### Concept 1

In case of obligation (to say that it is necessary to do something) → We use ‘must’ or ‘have (got) to’.

Every guest in this party ***must / has (got) to*** be thoroughly searched.

To get a pass to the gala, you ***must / have (got) to*** know someone in the palace.

#### Concept 2

‘Must’ only has present tense form (no past tense, no participles, etc.). 

So, 'must' refers to the present or the near future (not the past). <br>
To talk about the past we use ‘had to’ (the past form of ‘have to’).

I ***must*** go to college. (talking about present)

Yesterday I ***had to*** go to college. (talking about past)

#### Concept 3

For future obligations (to say that it will be necessary for someone to do something in the future) → We can also use ‘will have to’, apart from ‘must’, ‘have (got) to’:

To complete my project, I ***must / have (got) to / will have to*** meet the professor.

‘Have got to’ is less formal than the others (used in spoken English). Also, in formal English we prefer ‘have to’ rather than ‘have got to’.

We can also use ‘need (to)’ with a similar meaning:

Before submitting your project, you ***need to / must / have (got) to*** consult the professor.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Concept 4: ‘must’ Vs. ‘have (got) to’

When the obligation comes from the speaker → We generally use ‘must’. <br>
When the obligation comes from somewhere else → We generally use ‘have (got) to’. 

Compare: <br>
I ***must*** start coding daily. (It is my own idea.) <br>
I ***have to*** start coding on a daily basis. (my teacher has told me to code daily.)

Also, to talk about a necessity that is characteristic of a person → We prefer ‘have (got) to’: <br>
Annu ***has got to*** have at least ten hours of sleep everyday.

<!-- #### Concept 5

To express moral obligation or desirability → We use ‘ought (to)’.

We ***ought to*** respect our teachers.

I ***ought to*** guide him.

We can also use ‘ought (to) + $V_1$’ to express strong obligation.

You ***ought to*** obey your parents. (strong obligation)

If you have made a mistake you ***ought to*** apologize. (strong obligation)

‘ought + to have’ shows stronger obligation than ‘should have’. 
{{% /alert %}}

To convey the meaning that you should have but you didn't → We use ought + to have + $V_3$

You ***ought to have obeyed*** your parents.
