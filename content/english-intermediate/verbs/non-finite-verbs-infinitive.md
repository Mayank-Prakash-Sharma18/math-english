## What are Infinitives?

Infinitives – they are nouns with certain qualities of a verb (hence an infinitive is a Verb – Noun). 

They are generally either in the form of $V_1$ (bare infinitive) or 'to + $V_1$' (to infinitive).

I want ***to go***. (to go – infinitive)	

Unlike gerunds and participles, infinitives do not have any special suffixes (i.e. the verbs are unconjugated). They are always in the simple, singular form. 

Alka has decided ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">to marries</span>*** you. (incorrect) <br>
Alka has decided ***<span class="mak-text-color">to marry</span>*** you. (correct)


### How is Infinite a Verb-Noun?

***To respect*** our parents is our duty. <br>
to respect – infinitive working as noun is the subject of the verb ‘is’. But, like a verb it also takes an object (to respect whom? – our parents). 

Many men desire ***to make*** money quickly. <br>
to make – infinitive working as noun is the object of the verb ‘desire’. But, like a verb it also takes an object (to make what? – money). Also, just as a verb, it is modified by an adverb (quickly).

So, we can see that an infinitive is a kind of noun with certain features of verb, such as:
* it can take an object (when the verb in the infinitive is transitive) and 
* it can have adverbial qualifiers. 


### Infinitive Phrase 

Infinitive Phrase - a group of words consisting of an infinitive and the modifier(s)

Mr. Stevens has agreed ***to give us a ride***. (to give us a ride - infinitive phrase working as object)

us - indirect object of action expressed in infinitive; a ride - direct object of action expressed in infinitive.


### Negative infinitive 

Negative infinitive - formed by putting not in front of any form of the infinitive.

Nadal decided ***not to paly*** in French open.

I had better ***not call*** the lawyer.

Sometimes, instead of the infinitive being negative, the verb in the main clause is negative:

The president ***wants*** to reward them. <br>
The president ***doesn’t want*** to reward them.
{{% /alert %}}


### Anaphoric ‘to’

Anaphoric ‘to’ is used when the same infinitive is to be repeated.

Consider this sentence: <br>
I do not want ***to study*** right now, but I have ***to study***.

We can also write this sentence as follows: <br>
I do not want ***to study*** right now, but I have ***to***. (the last ‘to’ is an anaphoric ‘to’)

So, instead of repeating the verb again, we can just write ‘to’ in the second part of the sentence. 


### Split infinitives

Split infinitives - when additional words (generally an adverb) are included between 'to' and the verb in an infinitive. 

To correct a split infinitive, move those words (e.g. modifiers etc.) to a different position in the sentence.

Examples:

I like ***to*** on a rainy day ***eat*** French fries. (to ... eat – split infinitive) <br>
On a rainy day, I like ***to eat*** French fries. (rephrased sentence)

I wanted ***to*** quickly ***jump*** into the pool. (to ... jump – split infinitive) <br>
I wanted ***to jump*** into the pool quickly. (rephrased sentence)


### ‘To’ Preposition Phrase Vs. Infinitive

Notice the difference:

Prepositional phrase beginning with to: to + a noun or a pronoun (and any modifiers) <br>
E.g. to you, to Rajasthan.

Infinitive: to + verb <br>
E.g. to enter, to go. (here to is not acting as a preposition, but rather it is a particle of the infinitive.)


## Infinitive as various parts of speech 

### Concept 1

Apart from functioning as a noun, an Infinitive can also function as adjective, or an adverb in a sentence. 

When the infinitive works as a Noun it is called the Simple Infinitive. And when it works as an adjective, adverb or absolutely, it is called the Gerundial or Qualifying Infinitive.

***To swim*** is fun. (to swim – noun, working as the subject of the verb ’is’) <br>
I like ***to swim***. (to swim – noun, working as the object of the verb ’like’) <br>
She had a suggestion ***to offer***. (to offer - adjective modifying the noun ‘suggestion’) <br>
He yelled ***to warn*** her. (to warn - adverb modifying the verb ’yelled’)

When infinitive functions as an adverb and is the beginning phrase in a sentence, we should place a comma after it.

***To improve*** your marks, you must take guidance from your class teacher.
{{% /alert %}}

### Concept 2

As an Adverb :

* Infinitive can qualify a Verb, usually to express purpose. <br>
She came ***to see*** whether you are alright. (came – verb; purpose of checking on the health) <br>
They planned ***to kill*** the Governor. (planned – verb; purpose of killing)

* Infinitive can qualify an Adjective. <br>
These Indian dishes are good ***to eat***. (good - adjective) <br>
The students are anxious ***to learn*** about the exam result. (anxious - adjective)

### Concept 3

As Absolute phrase, Infinitive can qualify a sentence.

***To tell*** the truth, I was not amused by his jokes. (To tell the truth – absolute phrase)

He was petrified, so ***to speak***. (so to speak – absolute phrase)


## Infinitive asvarious parts of a sentence 

Apart from working as a subject or an object in a sentence, an infinitive can also function as:

There is no option except ***to win*** the next math. (to win – object of the preposition ‘except’) 

Her ambition is ***to win***. (to win - subject complement)

His ambition ***to become*** a footballer became an obsession. (to become a footballer - appositive)


## Infinitive and Tense

As infinitive is a non-finite verb, so it has no tense – present, past, future. It depends on the finite verb to give a time reference. 

He ***is*** happy ***to win*** the medal ('is' provides the present time reference) <br>
He ***wants to win*** the medal. ('wants' provides the present time reference) <br>
He ***was*** happy ***to win*** the medal. ('was'  provides the past time reference) <br>
He ***will be*** happy ***to win*** the medal. (‘will be’ provides the future time reference)


## Infinitive and Aspect (The forms of the infinitive)

Though infinitive has no tense, but it can have aspect (i.e. indefinite, continuous, perfect, perfect continuous).

Aspect of an infinitive shows the temporal relationship between the action expressed by the infinitive and the time of the preceding verb. 

There are four types/forms of infinitives (which showcases various aspects), each of which has an active and passive form.

Generally when we refer to infinitive we are usually referring to the simple present infinitive. 

However, there are three other forms of the infinitive: 

* continuous infinitive

* perfect infinitive

* perfect continuous infinitive

There are also passive forms of these infinitives.

### Simple Present Infinitive

The present infinitive has two forms:

* to-infinitive = to + $V_1$ <br>
I like to run.

* zero/bare infinitive = $V_1$ <br>
Generally when used with modal verbs (e.g. can, should and could) and certain other verbs like see and hear. <br>
I might ***run*** to the store.

There is no difference in meaning between the two forms of present infinitive. It’s just that some structures require a to-infinitive, while others go with bare infinitive.

### Continuous infinitive

The continuous infinitive: to be + present participle, e.g. to be playing.

Just like simple infinitive, continuous infinitive too refers to the same time as that of the preceding verb. It expresses an action in progress or happening over a period of time.   

I am glad ***to be playing*** here. (preceding verb – am)

Vijay Mallya was reported ***to be staying*** in London last week. (preceding verb – was reported)

As with the present infinitive, we sometimes use the zero form of the continuous infinitive (generally after most modal auxiliaries, and in other places where zero infinitives are used).

You must ***be joking***. (preceding verb – must)

Probably this day next month, I will ***be lying*** on my own bed at home. (preceding verb – will)

### Perfect infinitive

The perfect infinitive: to have + past participle, e.g. to have seen.

Perfect infinitive refers to a time before that of the preceding verb. 

I am glad ***to have studied*** at that university. (preceding verb – am) <br>
The ship was assumed ***to have left*** yesterday. (preceding verb – was assumed) 

We sometimes use the zero form of the perfect infinitive:

Arthur must ***have forgotten*** about the show. (preceding verb – must) <br>
By next year, they will ***have finished*** the course. (preceding verb – will)

{{% alert note %}}
Perfect infinitive form is most commonly found in conditional sentences (Type 3), using the conditional perfect.

For example: <br>
If I had known you were cheating, I would have called the principal.

### Perfect continuous infinitive

The perfect continuous infinitive: to have been + present participle, e.g. to have been crying. 

Just like perfect infinitive, perfect continuous infinitive refers to a time before that of the preceding verb. It expresses an action in progress or happening over a period of time. 

I am lucky ***to have been living*** with you for the last two months. (preceding verb – am) <br>
The terrorists were thought ***to have been digging*** the tunnel for days. (preceding verb – were thought)

We sometimes use the zero form of the perfect continuous infinitive:

She must ***have been preparing*** for long. (preceding verb – must) <br>
By this time tomorrow, the engine will ***have been running*** for forty hours. (preceding verb – will)

### Passive infinitives

The passive infinitive: to be + past participle, e.g. to be closed, to be given

There are various passive forms too:

My script has ***to be written***. (passive simple infinitive; preceding verb – has) <br>
Nelson’s phone was believed ***to be being tapped***. (passive continuous infinitive; preceding verb – was believed) <br>
This poem must ***have been written*** by Kalidas. (passive perfect infinitive; preceding verb – must) <br>
This building is believed ***to have been being made*** for years. (passive perfect continuous infinitive; preceding verb – is believed)

Passive continuous infinitive and Passive perfect continuous infinitive are not that commonly used.
