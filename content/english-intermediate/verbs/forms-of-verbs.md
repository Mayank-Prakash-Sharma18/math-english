There are five forms of verbs. Apart from this, there are regular and irregular forms of verbs. Let's study them. 

<img src="../../../media/verbs/verbs-1.png" alt="verbs" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

## Base Form 

The base form is the plain, infinitive or dictionary form. 

Used when the verb's action happens in the present and the subject is:
* a plural noun, or 
* the first person pronoun (I, we), or 
* second person pronoun (you), or 
* third person plural pronoun (they).

## $V_{S/ES}$ Form

The -s form of a verb is made from the base form of that verb. 

Used when the verb's action is in the present and the subject is third-person singular. 

Third-person singular is:
* a singular noun (examples: table, Geetanjali), or 
* a singular indefinite pronoun (examples: someone, everybody), or 
* personal pronoun (he, she, it).

So, Regular verbs in simple present tense have the same form for all persons and all numbers (singular or plural), except third person singular, which ends in -s.

### Making $V_{S/ES}$ Form

#### Type 1

If the verb ends in -s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, -o or -z, then -es is added to make the third person singular present simple.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Base form</th>
    <th>$V_{S/ES}$ Form</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>catch</td>
    <td>catches</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pass</td>
    <td>passes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>wish</td>
    <td>wishes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>fix</td>
    <td>fixes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>go</td>
    <td>goes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Type 2

consonant + y → we change y to i and add -es

try - tries

#### Type 3

In all other cases we just add -s

eat - eats

## Past and Past Participle forms 

Based on how past and past participle forms of a verb are formed, they have been divided into two types – Regular and Irregular verbs. 

Let’s see some examples of regular and irregular verbs

### Regular Verbs

#### Type 1

Most of the Regular verbs form their past tense and past participle by adding ed to the verb’s base form.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Base Form</th>
    <th>Past Tense</th>
    <th>Past Participle</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>walk</td>
    <td>walked</td>
    <td>walked</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>jump</td>
    <td>jumped</td>
    <td>jumped</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>paint</td>
    <td>painted</td>
    <td>painted</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Type 2

If the base form already ends in -e, then to make the past form and the past participle form we just add -d. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Base Form</th>
    <th>Past Tense</th>
    <th>Past Participle</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>agree</td>
    <td>agreed</td>
    <td>agreed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>like</td>
    <td>liked</td>
    <td>liked</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>die</td>
    <td>died</td>
    <td>died</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The final -e is not used in the -ing form.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Type 3

If the base form ends in a consonant plus -y, then to make the past form and the past participle form we just change -y to -ied. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Base Form</th>
    <th>Past Tense</th>
    <th>Past Participle</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>carry</td>
    <td>carried</td>
    <td>carried</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>study</td>
    <td>studied</td>
    <td>studied</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>fry</td>
    <td>fried</td>
    <td>fried</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The -y ending does not change in the -ing form.

### Iregular Verbs

There is no definite rule as such when it comes to forming past tense and past participle forms of irregular verbs. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Base Form</th>
    <th>Past Tense</th>
    <th>Past Participle</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sit</td>
    <td>sat</td>
    <td>sat</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ring</td>
    <td>rang</td>
    <td>rung</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>come</td>
    <td>came</td>
    <td>come</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cut</td>
    <td>cut</td>
    <td>cut</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

We distinguish three types of irregular verbs:
* Verbs in which all three forms are the same (e.g. cut - cut - cut)
* Verbs in which two of the three forms are the same (e.g. sit - sat - sat)
* Verbs in which all three forms are different (e.g. ring - rang - rung)

#### Type 1: All three forms are the same

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Base Form</th>
    <th>Past Tense</th>
    <th>Past Participle</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>bet</td>
    <td>bet</td>
    <td>bet</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cost</td>
    <td>cost</td>
    <td>cost</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>hit</td>
    <td>hit</td>
    <td>hit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>hurt</td>
    <td>hurt</td>
    <td>hurt</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

#### Type 2: Two of the forms are the same

There are 3 possibilities here:
* Base Form and Past Tense Form are the same
* Base Form and Past Participle Form are the same
* Past Tense Form and Past Participle Form are the same

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Base Form</th>
    <th>Past Tense</th>
    <th>Past Participle</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>beat</td>
    <td>beat</td>
    <td>beaten</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>bend</td>
    <td>bent</td>
    <td>bent</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>come</td>
    <td>came</td>
    <td>come</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>bring</td>
    <td>brought</td>
    <td>brought</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

#### Type 3: All three forms are different

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Base Form</th>
    <th>Past Tense</th>
    <th>Past Participle</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>be</td>
    <td>was/were</td>
    <td>been</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>begin</td>
    <td>began</td>
    <td>begun</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>break</td>
    <td>broke</td>
    <td>broken</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>drive</td>
    <td>drove</td>
    <td>driven</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

{{% alert note %}}
The only verb with more than 5 forms is 'be'.

That's because it has different forms for different persons in case of Simple Present and Simple Past tenses. 

* The verb 'be' has 3 present tense forms: am, is, are  (all other verbs have one form). <br>
I ***am***, She/He/It ***is***, You/We/They ***are***

* The verb 'be' has 2 past tense forms: was, were (all other verbs have one form). <br>
I/She/He/It ***was***, You/We/They ***were*** 

* The verb 'be' has 1 past participle form: been (other verbs have one or two past participle forms).

* The verb 'be' has 1 present participle form: being.

* The verb 'be' does not have any $V_{s/es}$ form.

## Alternative past participle form 

There are certain verbs with two distinct past participle ($V_3$) forms. In such cases, one form is usually used as an adjective form.

Here's a list of the verbs that have an alternative past participle form (generally ending in 'en'), which can only be used adjectivally, e.g. ***Spoken*** English, ***Revised*** edition,	***Written*** document. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Base Form</th>
    <th>Usual Past Participle</th>
    <th>Adjectival Past Participle</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>drink</td>
    <td>drunk</td>
    <td>drunken</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>learn</td>
    <td>learnt</td>
    <td>learned</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>prove</td>
    <td>proved</td>
    <td>proven</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>shear</td>
    <td>sheared</td>
    <td>shorn</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

Compare the following:

Workers have ***loaded*** the trucks with bamboos. <br>
Trees were ***laden*** with fruits. 

He has ***proved*** it. <br>
It's a ***proven*** fact.

Present tense ($V_1$ /base form and $V_{e/es}$ form) and Past tense ($V_2$) form can function as main verb in a sentence. 

I drink milk every night. (drink - $V_1$) <br>
She works at the factory. (works - $V_{e/es}$) <br>
He opened the door of the car. (opened - $V_2$)

Present form of the verb or first form, expresses the simple and future present tense (for future tense we use modal verb + $V_1$, e.g. will play). Similarly, the past form of the verb, or the second form, expresses the simple past tense (also called the past indefinite tense). 

Past participle ($V_3$) and Present participle ($V_4$/$V_{ing}$) form cannot function as the main verb alone. They are non-finite verbs and so they need helping verbs 'have' and 'be' (i.e. finite verbs) to function as the main verb in a sentence. $V_3$ and $V_4$ will always be the non-finite part of any verb phrase. 

I have given one week’s notice. (have – helping verb; given - $V_3$) <br>
They were playing a piano. (were – helping verb; playing – $V_4$)

While making passive voice too, past participles need ‘be’, i.e. be + past participle. 

However, Past participles can function as an adjective too. And when acting as an adjective, they do not need a helping verb. 

Also, as we saw earlier, some Past participles ($V_3$) have a dedicated form for working as an adjective. That is, they have two forms:
* one form is used while they are part of a verb phrase, and 
* another form is used when they function as an adjective in a sentence. 

We will learn more about using these various forms of verbs to make different tenses in the tenses module.
