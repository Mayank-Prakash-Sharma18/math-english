## Functions of the to-infinitive

### Function 1

to-infinitive is used to indicate the purpose/intention of an action <br>
(so here to-infinitive = 'in order to' or 'so as to')

He came ***to collect*** his payment. (to collect = in order to / so as to)

### Function 2

to-infinitive is used to indicate what something will (or can) be used for. <br>
(here to-infinitive will come after a noun or pronoun and modify it)

I would like a glass of milk ***to drink***.

In most such cases, the to-infinitive works as a post-modifier of: 
* abstract nouns (e.g. desire, refusal, wish, ability etc.) and 
* indefinite pronouns (e.g. something, one, anything) 

Have a look at the following examples:

I have no desire ***to play*** for your club. (desire - abstract noun) <br>
There is no need ***to jump***. (need - abstract noun) <br>
You have no one ***to talk*** to. (one - indefinite pronoun)

### Function 3

to-infinitive is used to make a comment/judgement about a noun/noun phrase.

Pattern: Subject + be + noun phrase + to-infinitive

It was a rough strip ***to land***. <br>
That is a dangerous way ***to drive***. <br>
Mayank is the best candidate ***to hire***.

### Function 4

to-infinitive is often used after certain adjectives. 

Pattern: Subject + be + adjective + (for/of someone) + to-infinitive

She is perfect for you ***to marry***. (perfect - adjective)

{{% alert note %}}
We us the preposition 'for/of' to show who these adjectives refer to.
{{% /alert %}}

We often use this pattern (it + be + adjective) to give our opinion on some topic or about some person. <br> 
It was good of you ***to help***. (good - adjective) <br>
It is important for Nicole ***to be*** patient. (important - adjective)

Sometimes, the to-infinitive provides the reason for the adjective, or clarify its meaning. Especially, the adjectives having the words ‘too/enough’ require infinitives to complete the meaning. <br>
It is good ***to be*** here. (good - adjective)	<br>
It is too hard ***to be*** a home maker. (too hard - adjective) <br>
Aanya is wealthy enough ***to spend*** Rs. 1000 on her haircut. (wealthy enough - adjective)

{{% alert note %}}
Basically, ***too*** and ***enough*** are adverbs placed before or after the adjectives or adverbs that they modify. 
{{% /alert %}}

### Function 5

To express purpose implying future time, we use the following pattern: <br>
Pattern: Verb (first action) + to + $V_1$ (infinitive) (second action) 

I am going to the USA to have bought some laptops for my company. (incorrect)<br>
I am going to the USA ***to buy*** some laptops for my company. (correct)

To express completion of action, we use the following pattern: <br>
Pattern: Verb (second action) + to have (been) + $V_3$ (Perfect infinitive) (first action)  

<!-- Some people reported to hear a very strange noise in the night. <br>
Some people reported ***to have heard*** a very strange noise in the night. (reported – second action; to have heard – first action) -->

Mr. Bose is believed to die in a plane crash. (incorrect)<br>
Mr. Bose is believed ***to have died*** in a plane crash. (correct)


## Functions of the zero infinitive

### Function 1

Bare infinitive (infinitive without ‘to’) is used after modals.

I will ***play*** today.

You should ***work*** smartly.

### Function 2

'Need' and 'Dare' take bare infinitives when they are used as auxiliary verbs in negative and interrogative sentences.

You need not to worry. (incorrect) <br>
You need not worry. (correct)

Need I to take this test? (incorrect) <br>
Need I take this test? (correct)

We dare not to disobey the inspector. (incorrect) <br>
We dare not disobey the inspector. (correct)

### Function 3

Bare infinitive is also used after – ‘had better, had sooner, had rather, would rather, would better, would rather, sooner than, rather than’.

You had better ***ask*** permission.

I would rather ***die*** than be a traitor.

{{% alert note %}}
Negative particles should not be used between them. (e.g. we cannot write ‘would not rather’). However,  we can do so in interrogative sentences.
{{% /alert %}}

### Function 4

Bare infinitive is also used in the following cases:

* With 'Why not' <br>
Why not ***play*** now? (play - bare infinitive)

* Bare infinitive is used after 'have + object‘ when it is used in the sense of expressing wish. <br>
I will have him ***speak*** the truth. (have him - 'have + object’)


## Verbs and Infinitives

Some verbs are almost always followed by to-infinitives and some almost always by bare infinitives.

Let’s see some examples: 

### Concept 1: Verbs that are followed by bare infinitives

We use bare infinitive after the following verbs – bid, make, help, feel, see, watch, hear (when they are used in Active voice). 

My dad ***made*** me do the home work. (do - bare infinitive)

I ***watched*** her go. (go - bare infinitive)

But when these verbs are used in passive voice, we use 'to + $V_1$' (Infinitive) and not bare infinitive after them.

I was ***made*** to clean the car. (to clean – to-infinitive)

### Concept 2: Let

With let we always use bare infinitive (both active and passive voice)

I will not let her go. (Active voice) <br>
Bad habits must be let go. (Passive voice)

Let me ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">to go</span>*** there. (incorrect) <br>
Let me ***<span class="mak-text-color">go</span>*** there. (correct) 

### Concept 3: Want

With ‘want’ we use ‘to-infinitives’ almost always, except some cases.

I want ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">work</span>*** for you. (incorrect) <br>
I want ***<span class="mak-text-color">to work</span>*** for you. (correct) 

### Concept 4

We use bare infinitive after verbs of perception (e.g. see, hear, feel etc.)

Pattern: verb + object + bare infinitive.

She ***saw him fall*** from the horse.

I ***heard him fire*** the gun.

He ***felt a snake crawl*** up his leg.

### Concept 5

Subject + do/does/did + everything / nothing + but + [$V_1$ / <s>to + V1</s>] <br>
Subject + any other verb + everything / nothing + but + [<s>V1</s> / to + $V_1$]

Meenakshi does nothing but ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">to study</span>*** all the time. (incorrect) <br>
Meenakshi does nothing but ***<span class="mak-text-color">study</span>*** all the time. (correct; does - verb)

We want nothing but ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">help</span>*** you become the Prime minister of India once again. (incorrect) <br>
We want nothing but ***<span class="mak-text-color">to help</span>*** you become the Prime minister of India once again. (correct; want - verb)


## Question words and Infinitives

### Concept 1

to-infinitive is often used with question words (how, where, what, who, and when). 

This question word + to-infinitive pattern often comes after verbs such as ask, decide, explain, forget, know, show, tell, understand, learn, teach, discover etc.

He asked me ***how to use*** the Camtasia video-editor. <br>
I have no idea ***where to place*** this puzzle piece. <br>
Can you tell ***what to do***? <br>
Let me know ***when to press*** the alarm button. <br>
I'm not sure I know ***who to call***.

They know ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">to write</span>*** letters. (incorrect) <br>
They know ***<span class="mak-text-color">how to write</span>*** letters. (correct)

### Concept 2

After 'why' the bare infinitive is used (used for making suggestions).

Pattern: Why + (not) + Bare infinitive .......? (Interrogative sentence) 

***Why tell*** anyone? (tell - bare infinitive)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Why to learn</span>*** English if it is difficult to learn. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Why learn</span>*** English if it is difficult to learn. (correct)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Why not to go</span>*** to the temple every day? (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Why not go</span>*** to the temple every day? (correct)
