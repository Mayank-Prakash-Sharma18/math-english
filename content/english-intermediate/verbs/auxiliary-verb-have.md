In this article we are going to study about the Auxiliary Verb 'have'. 

<img src="../../../media/verbs/verbs-6.png" alt="verbs" style="width:36%;height:36%;">

## 'have' as helping verb and main verb

‘have’ can function as helping verb.

I ***have*** been sleeping in the attic. (have – helping verb; sleeping – main verb)

‘have’ can also be used as the main verb in a sentence.

I ***have*** a vintage car. (have – working here as main verb, here it means ‘to own’)


## Uses of 'have'

### Use Case 1: Negative and Interrogative sentences

Various forms of auxiliary verb ‘have’ are used in the formation of negative and interrogative sentences.

In negatives sentences and questions, have to and had to are used with do, does, did.

Do they ***have*** to work?
	
He does not ***have*** to work. <br> 
Does he ***have*** to work?

### Use Case 2: Tenses

Various forms of auxiliary verb ‘have’ help the main verbs in expressing the tense.

Various forms of 'have' are used in the formation of the perfect tenses (i.e. perfect tenses and perfect continuous tenses).

He ***has played*** state level tennis. (present perfect tense; has – helping verb) 

I ***have been playing*** state level tennis. (present perfect continuous tense; have – helping verb)


## Have vs Have got

### Possession

#### Concept 1

Sometimes we can use either ‘have’ or ‘have got’ when we talk about possession, relationships, and similar meanings. 

Use of ‘have’ is often considered more formal.

I ***have*** a ring. (correct; have – working as main verb here) <br>
I ***have got*** a ring. (correct)

The minister ***has*** a lot of support for his plans. (correct) <br>
The minister ***has got*** a lot of support for his plans. (correct)

#### Concept 2

But sometimes we prefer ‘have got’ over ‘have’.

I ***don't have*** anything on this weekend. (correct; sounds fine) <br>
I ***haven't got*** anything on this weekend. (correct; sounds fine) <br>
I ***haven't*** anything on this weekend. (sounds odd)

### ‘have’ followed by the infinitive

#### Concept 1

We use ‘have’ (not ‘have got’), in to-infinitive or -ing forms, and after modal verbs.

Do you want ***to have*** a cup of coffee? (to have – to-infinitive)

I find ***having*** no bike very inconvenient.

They would not ***have*** that old villa for much longer. They are looking for a new one. (would – modal verb)

Note that, when ‘have got’ means 'obtain' or 'receive', we can use it in to-infinitive, -ing forms, or after modal verbs. 

Sometimes we can use ‘have’ instead of ‘have got’ with a similar meaning.

#### Concept 2: Uses of 'have to'

‘have’ is used with the infinitive (‘have to’) to indicate obligation.

She ***has to*** complete the assignment herself. <br>
I ***have to*** be there by tonight.

The past form, 'had to' is used to express obligation in the past.

She ***had to*** complete the assignment herself. <br>
I ***had to*** be there by tonight.


### To talk about past, present and future

#### Concept 1

When we talk about the future or the past, we use ‘have’ (rather than ‘have got’). 

Compare the following set of sentences:

Talking about Present: <br>
I ***have*** time to play with my dog. (correct) <br>
I ***have got*** time to play with my dog. (correct)

Talking about Future: <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color">will have</span>*** time to play with my dog tomorrow. (correct) <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">will have got</span>*** time to play with my dog tomorrow. (incorrect)

Talking about Past: <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color">had</span>*** time to play with my dog yesterday. (correct) <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">had got</span>*** time to play with my dog yesterday. (incorrect)

Note that, when ‘have got’ means 'obtain' or 'receive', we can use it in case of past and future too. 

Sometimes we can use ‘have’ instead of ‘have got’ with a similar meaning.

#### Concept 2

We also say ‘used to have’ (and not 'used to have got‘). Because ‘used to’ refers to past time. 

I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">used to have got</span>*** a big house. (incorrect) <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color">used to have</span>*** a big house. (correct)


### Other differences

We don't use ‘have got’ in short answers.

'Have you got any product left?' - 'Yes, I ***have***.'
