## What are Participles?

Participle is a word that is formed from a verb and can act as a verb, an adjective or an adverb. 

They are ***watching*** a game. <br>
(watching - present participle and not a gerund, as here it has been used as a verb and not as a noun.)

{{% alert note %}}
Some participial adjectives have no corresponding verb form. We create them by combining a noun with a participle.

E.g. ***drug-induced*** coma (drug – noun; induced – participle; here drug-induced is an adjective describing the noun ‘coma’) 

***energy-boosting*** drink (energy – noun; boosting – participle; here energy-boosting is an adjective describing the noun ‘drink’)

We can also use these after the nouns they describe. <br>
E.g. Homeopathic medicines are ***alcohol-based***. (alcohol-based – an adjective working as subject complement)

### Participial phrase

Participial phrases - participles combined with other words.

For example:

***Wearing his new uniform***, Mragank went to work.  (wearing his new uniform - participial phrase acting as an adjective, describing the noun Mragank).


## Types of Participles

Verbs have five forms – base form ($V_1$), $V_{s/es}$ , $V_2$, $V_3$ and $V_4/V_{ing}$

The last two, i.e. Past Participle ($V_3$) and Present Participle ($V_4/V_{ing}$) are the two major types of participles.

Though there are three types of Participles in total:

* Present Participle ($V_4/V_{ing}$) -  each present participle ends in -ing, e.g. playing. 

* Past Participle ($V_3$) – they do not have the same ending. Past participles of regular verbs end in –ed (e.g. play - played), but that of irregular verbs vary considerably (e.g. write - written, sing - sung).

* Perfect Participle (having + $V_3$): i.e. having + Past Participle

All the three types of participles have passive forms too. 

<img src="../../../media/verbs/verbs-11.png" alt="verbs" style="width:81%;height:81%;">

We differentiate between the active and passive forms of participles in a sentence based on the sense they make. 

{{% alert note %}}
Perfect participle is not exactly a third type of participle. It is just a commonly used structure that features a present participle (‘having’) and then a past participle (any $V_3$, e.g. ‘written’, ‘eaten’, 'taken').
{{% /alert %}}

### Present Participle

Present Participle, denoted by $V_4/V_{ing}$ : Base form of the verb ($V_1$) + ing

E.g. hearing, walking, jumping etc.

They are ***watching*** a movie. (watching is a present participle here and not a gerund as here it has been used as a verb and not as a noun.)

I saw a ***burning*** tree. (burning is a present participle here and not a gerund as here it has been used as an adjective and not as a noun.)

In the above sentences '$V_1$ + ing' denotes an action going on or an incomplete action.

### Past Participle

Past Participle, denoted by $V_3$  

E.g. broken, wounded, gone etc. 

There is a ***wounded*** person outside. (wounded - past participle working as an adjective)

***Driven*** by poverty, she committed suicide. (driven by poverty – past participle phrase working as an adjective phrase)

Past Participle represents a completed action or state. 

### Perfect Participle

Perfect Participle: having + $V_3$ (third form of the verb)

After ***having finished*** his homework, she went to play. 

Perfect participle denotes a completed action, after the completion of which some time has passed.


## Participle as Adjective

Past and Present participles often function as adjectives that describe nouns. <br>
E.g.: crying girl, broken leg

When used as an adjective, past participle has a passive meaning, while present participle has an active meaning.

burnt house (past participle; a house that is burnt) <br>
falling boulder (present participle; a boulder that is falling)

Shouting loudly, she walked out. (She was shouting – Active meaning) <br>
Shouted at loudly, she walked out. (Someone else shouted at her – Passive meaning)

Some more examples:

A ***demotivated*** person can’t be successful.   (demotivated - past participle working as an adjective)

A person who is ***demotivated*** can’t be successful.   (demotivated - past participle working as an adjective; who is demotivated – relative clause)

A person, ***demotivated***, can't be successful. (demotivated - past participle working as an adjective)

### Adjective clause and Participle

We can substitute an adjective clause with a participle or participle phrase. 

There were a lot of windows in the villa ***that were broken***. (that were broken – adjective clause) <br>
There were a lot of ***broken*** windows in the villa. (broken – participle working as an adjective. This and the previous sentence have the same meaning.)

In the previous sentence, the participle ‘broken’ was before the noun ‘windows’ it was modifying. The participle can also come after the noun it describes. It is generally done to give more emphasis to participle. <br>
They don’t want to leave any stone ***unturned***. (unturned – participle working as an adjective, modifying the noun ‘stone’)

Participle working as an adjective can be subject complement too. <br>
You seem ***tired***. (tired - past participle working as subject complement)

It can act as object complement too. <br>
He kept me ***waiting***. (waiting – present participle working as object complement; it is modifying the object ‘me’.)

The flying lieutenant, ***who was dressed in sky blue uniform***, looked charming. (who was dressed in sky blue uniform – adjective clause) <br>
***Dressed in sky blue uniform***, the flying lieutenant looked charming. (Dressed in sky blue uniform – participle phrase working as an adjective, comes before the noun it describes. Such a participle phrase is usually separated by a comma. We dropped the subject and verb of the adjective phrase)

The girl, ***who is talking to Rohit***, is his fiancé. (who is talking to Rohit – adjective clause) <br>
The girl ***talking to Rohit*** is his fiancé. (talking to Rohit - participle phrase working as an adjective, comes after the noun it describes. We dropped the subject and verb of the adjective phrase)

### Participles used Absolutely

Participles may be used Absolutely (with a noun or pronoun going before):

Weather ***permitting***, there will be a full match tomorrow.

The sea ***being smooth***, the ship lifted its anchor.

<!-- ### Degree of participle adjectives 

Just like other adjectives, participle adjectives can have various degrees too (i.e. comparative and superlative forms). So, we can use them to compare different nouns. 

We do so by using intensifiers (e.g. very, extremely, more, and less). 

The news that Azerbaijan attacked Armenia was ***shocking***.

The news that Turkey was supporting Azerbaijan was ***more shocking***.   (more shocking - comparative form of the adjective; we are comparing two news)

That Pakistan and Turkey were sending terrorists to the war was the ***most shocking*** thing I have ever heard. (most shocking - superlative form of the adjective; we are comparing more than two news) -->


## Participle as Verb

English verbs have four forms:

Present tense ($V_1$ and $V_{s/es}$ - write/writes), Past tense ($V_2$ - wrote), Past participle ($V_3$ - written) and Present participle ($V_4$ - writing)

{{% alert note %}}
Some verbs have two past participle ($V_3$) forms, e.g. proved, proven.

### Property 1

When participles function as a verb, they denote aspect but not tense. 

* Present participle form – indicates an ongoing activity
* Past participle form – indicates a completed activity

To denote tense they need a helping verb. In such verb phrases, the helping verb(s) work as the finite verb part and participles work as the non-finite part. So, these helping verbs carry the tense and are also influenced by the subject’s number and person. 

Aanya has ***cooked*** dinner today. (has – helping verb as per the subject, showing present tense; cooked – past participle)

We have ***cooked*** dinner today. (have – helping verb as per the subject, showing present tense; cooked – past participle)

Aanya had ***cooked*** dinner yesterday. (had - helping verb, showing past tense; cooked – past participle)

Aanya will have ***cooked*** dinner by 8 P.M. (will, have – helping verbs; cooked - past participle)

### Property 2

As you already may have noticed, past participles do not necessarily refer to past time. As they do not denote tense, they can be used to show past, present or future time.

Tom Hanks had ***taken*** a vacation.   (Tense – Past, denoted by had; Aspect – perfect, denoted by past participle taken)

Tom Hanks has ***taken*** a vacation. (Tense – Present, denoted by has; Aspect – perfect, denoted by past participle taken)

Tom Hanks will have ***taken*** a vacation by the time this movie is released. (Tense – Future, denoted by will have; Aspect – perfect, denoted by past participle taken)

{{% alert note %}}
In case you are confused, Aspect denotes the position of the work denoted by the verb, i.e. whether it is complete or ongoing. 

In the above sentences, the past participle denotes perfect aspect, i.e. the action of taking the vacation is complete. In the first sentence, the work was completed in the past; in the second sentence, the work has been completed in the present; and in the third sentence, the work will be complete in the future.

<!-- ### Property 3

Participle verbal form is non-finite (both past and present participles) and so they cannot alone function as the main verb. For them to function as a main verb, they need a tense-carrying finite verb component.

Dan Brown is ***writing*** a new novel. (writing - non-finite present participle, working as main verb; is – carries the tense) <br>
Dan Brown has ***written*** a novel. (written - non-finite past participle, working as main verb; has – carries the tense)

Differences between the second form ($V_2$) and the third form ($V_3$) are: <br>
A past tense verbal form is a finite verb capable of functioning as the main verb alone. 

Dan Brown ***wrote*** a novel last year. (wrote – finite past tense form, working as main verb without the need of any helping verb)

So, Participles are used to make Verb Phrases/Tenses (continuous, perfect and perfect continuous tenses).

Present participles are used to make progressive (or continuous) verb tenses (forms of be + present participle): 

I am ***playing***. (present progressive tense) <br>
I was ***playing***. (past progressive tense) <br>
I will be ***playing***. (future progressive tense) <br>
(All these sentences indicate the process of playing.) 

{{% alert note %}}
We use forms of be + past participle to make passive sentences.
{{% /alert %}}

Past participles are used to make perfect verb tenses (forms of have + past participle): 

I have ***gone***. (present perfect tense) <br>
I had ***gone***. (past perfect tense) <br>
I will have ***gone***. (future perfect tense)

We use both past and present participles together to form perfect progressive tenses:

I have ***been playing***. (present perfect progressive tense; been - past participle; playing – present participle) <br>
I had ***been playing***. (past perfect progressive tense; been - past participle; playing – present participle) <br>
I will have ***been playing***. (future perfect progressive tense; been - past participle; playing – present participle)

### Property 4

A verb phrase can have as many as four parts (combination of helping verbs and participles).

For example:

Crocodiles ***ate*** many Japanese soldiers during world war II. (ate – simple past tense/$V_2$)

When soldiers arrived, the traitors ***were stabbing*** Julius Caesar. (were – helping verb; stabbing - present participle)

This hungry dog ***has been roaming*** in front of the main gate since long. (has – helping verb; been – past participle; roaming - present participle)

The hungry dog ***should have been fed*** by now. (should, have – helping verbs; been, fed – past participles) -->


## To identify Participle as adjective Vs Participle as a part of verb phrase

### Test for present participle - Use ‘very’ 

We can use ‘very’ to test whether a participle is working as a verb or as an adjective. ‘Very’ is a special kind of adverb which is generally used to modify an adjective and not a verb. So, if the sentence/phrase makes sense even when we use ‘very’ before the participle, then the participle most probably is an adjective.  

Consider the following sentences: 

This dog is ***annoying***. <br>
This dog is very ***annoying***. (it still makes sense; so here annoying is working as an adjective, and a subject complement; is – main verb)

This dog is ***annoying*** the workers. <br>
This dog is very ***annoying*** the workers. (makes no sense; so here annoying is working as a verb, in fact it is the main verb; is – helping verb)

{{% alert note %}}
This test is less reliable with -ed forms than it is with -ing forms of participles.

<!-- ### Test for present participle - Convert progressive form to non-progressive form

If we can change the continuous (-ing) form into a non-continuous form of verb, then that participle is working as a verb, otherwise it’s an adjective:  
                                  
The soldiers are ***singing***. <br>
The soldiers sing. (sounds fine, so singing – participle working as a verb)

My back is ***itching***. <br>    	
My back itches. (sounds fine, so itching – participle working as a verb)
 
Now see these sentences:

The task was ***exiting***.	<br>
The task exited. (sounds odd, so here exiting - participle working as an adjective, which is the subject complement; task = exiting)

Her article was ***interesting***. <br>	 
Her article interested. (sounds odd, so here interesting - participle working as an adjective, which is the subject complement; her article = interesting) -->

### Test for past and present participle - Convert participle into a relative clause

If we can transform a participle into a relative clause then it means that it is working as a participle adjective, otherwise it is working as a verb.

These ***rotten*** eggs smell really bad. (rotten – past participle working as an adjective) <br>
The eggs ***that are rotten*** smell really bad. (that are rotten - relative clause)

Earthquake has ***destroyed*** the whole town. (destroyed – past participle working as a verb) <br>
Earthquake ***that has destroyed*** the whole town. (sounds incomplete)

The ***barking*** dogs did not let me concentrate. (barking – present participle working as an adjective) <br>
The dogs ***that were barking*** did not let me concentrate. (that were barking - relative clause)

Those cats are ***eating*** fish. (eating – present participle working as a verb) <br>
Those cats ***that are eating*** fish.  (sounds incomplete) 

### Test for past participle - Presence of a ‘by’ preposition phrase and ‘that’ clause

Presence of a ‘by’ preposition phrase is an indication that the -ed form of participle is working as a verb. 

Conversely, if a complement is present (e.g. a that-clause), then it’s an indication that the participle is working as an adjective.   

The judge was ***convinced*** by the lawyer's argument. (convinced – participle working as a verb; action of convincing was done by the arguments of the lawyer.)

The judge was ***convinced*** that the defendant was guilty. (convinced – participle working as an adjective; convinced here is a subject complement, describing the subject; judge = convinced)

<!-- ### Test for past participle – Two different forms

Some verbs have two past participle ($V_3$) forms, one of which always works as a verb, and the other as an adjective. So, in such cases it is easier to identify whether the past participle is working as a verb or as an adjective.

I have ***proved*** my point. (proved – past participle form that works as a verb)

My point has been ***proven***. (proven – past participle form that works as an adjective) -->


## Participle in Passive Voice

Passive voice is formed as follows: to be + past participle

The cows ***are milked*** twice a day. (are – a form of the verb ‘be’; milked – past participle)

The goon ***was captured*** near the toll plaza. (was – a form of the verb ‘be’; captured – past participle)

Players ***will be taken*** to the stadium by bus. (will – modal verb; be – a form of the verb ‘be’; taken – past participle)

There are various forms of passive voice, but past participles features in every one of them.


## Participle as Adverb

Participles can function as adverbs too, which describe how the verb was done.

Aanya came ***screaming*** out of the club. (came how? - screaming)

She came home ***crying***. (came home how? - crying)


## Present Participle Vs Gerund

### Concept 1

If the –ing form is working as a noun (with some characteristics of a verb), then that’s a gerund and if it’s working as an adjective or verb, then it’s a present participle. 

***Reading*** is my hobby.  (reading – gerund, as it is working as a noun, which is the subject of the sentence)

I like ***reading***.  (reading – gerund, as it is working as a noun, which is the object of the sentence)

{{% alert note %}}
For those who know Hindi, gerund will sound as na, ne, ni, e.g. padhna
{{% /alert %}}

I saw him ***reading***. (reading – present participle, it is working as an adjective)

{{% alert note %}}
For those who know Hindi, present participle will sound as –te hue, e.g. padhte hue
{{% /alert %}}

### Concept 2

Whether an -ing form is a gerund or a present participle can sometimes be a matter of interpretation:

***Hunting*** wolves can be dangerous. 

This is an ambiguous sentence which can have two different meanings.

If in the above sentence, hunting is a present participle working as an adjective that describes wolves, then the sentence means: <br>
‘Wolves that hunt’ can be dangerous.

If instead, hunting is a gerund, then wolves is the object of the gerund and the sentence means: <br>
‘To hunt wolves’ can be dangerous.
