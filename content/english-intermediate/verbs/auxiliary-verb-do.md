<img src="../../../media/verbs/verbs-5.png" alt="verbs" style="width:27%;height:27%;">

## 'do' as helping verb and main verb

‘do’ can function as helping verb.

I ***do*** know him. (do – helping verb; know – main verb)

‘do’ can also be used as the main verb in a sentence.

I already ***did*** my homework. (did – working here as main verb)


## Uses of 'do'

### Use Case 1: Negative and Interrogative sentences

Various forms of auxiliary verb ‘do’ are used in the formation of negative and interrogative sentences.

I ***do*** not play cricket. 

***Do*** you play cricket?

### Use Case 2: To Emphasize

The various forms of ‘do’ are also used to emphasize the affirmative nature of a statement.

I told her not to cheat, but she ***did*** cheat.

You ***do*** look sick.

### Use Case 3: To Persuade

‘do’ makes a request or invitation more persuasive in imperative sentences. In such sentences, ‘do’ is strongly stressed.  

Oh, ***do*** come to the party! 

### Use Case 4: To avoid repetition of Verbs

The auxiliary 'do' is used to avoid repetition of a previous ordinary verb.

Do you like her? - Yes, I ***do***.

You met her, ***didn't*** you?

She drinks milk and so ***do*** you.

### Use Case 5: As an alternative to certain Verbs

We can use 'do' instead of another verb to talk about certain jobs (in informal English).

Can you ***do the dishes*** before we go to bed? (do the dishes = clean the dishes)

Aren't you going to ***do your hair***? It looks untidy. (do your hair = comb/brush your hair)

### Use Case 6: To talk about general activities

We also use ‘do’ when we talk about general or indefinite rather than particular activities.

I guess John has ***done*** something to the laptop. It’s not booting up.

***Did*** you ***do*** anything about the flat tyre? 

We sometimes specify particular actions after first introducing the actions in general with ‘do’.

I ***did*** a lot of work today. I ***finished*** my homework, I ***ordered*** some new books...

<!-- ### Use Case 7

We use ‘do’ with gerund (an -ing form as a noun) when we talk about jobs and leisure activities. 

A word or phrase such as ‘the’, ‘some’, ‘a bit of’, ‘a lot of’, etc. is usually used before such nouns (e.g. cleaning, cooking, gardening, shopping, washing (up), ironing, skiing, painting etc.).

Compare the following sentences: <br>
I am going to ***paint***. (correct) <br>	
I am going to ***do some painting***. (correct) 

{{% alert note %}}
Generally, if there is an object after the verb, we can't make a sentence with a similar meaning with do ... -ing.

I am going to ***read*** some books. (correct; some books – object of the verb ‘read’) <br>
I am going to do some book reading. (incorrect) 

However, we can talk in this way about bird watching, letter-writing, note-taking, sightseeing.

I am going to ***watch*** some birds. (correct; some birds – object of the verb ‘watch’) <br>
I am going to ***do*** some bird watching. (correct) 
{{% /alert %}} -->
