In this article we are going to study about the Modal Verbs 'shall, should, will, would'. 

## Shall Vs. Will 

### Concept 1 

We can use 'will’ with all the three persons to express pure future.

We use ‘shall’ only with first person 'I' and 'we' in future tense. But note that nowadays, ‘I/We shall’ is less common than ‘I/We will’.
