In this article we are going to study about the Modal Verb 'used to'. 

We use 'used to' to talk about a habit. Let's see some of the concepts related to it. 

## Uses of Used to 

### Concept 1

To express a past discontinued habit/situation → We use ‘used (to)’.

We ***used to*** play here when we were kids. 

There ***used to*** be a stadium here.

But we do not use ‘use to' or ‘uses to' to express present habit or routine action in affirmative sentences. 

Instead we use simple present tense for such purpose.

He ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">uses to</span>*** play till 11 a.m. and takes his lunch at 12 noon. (incorrect) <br>
He ***<span class="mak-text-color">plays</span>*** till 11 a.m. and takes his lunch at 12 noon. (correct)

### Concept 2

Compare the use of 'used to' in affirmative/negative/interrogative sentence.

#### In Affirmative sentences

As we have already seen earlier, in affirmative sentences we use ‘used to’

Kohli ***used to*** play here.

#### In Negative sentences and Interrogative sentences

We use ‘used to’ or ‘did + use to’ <br>
But in such sentences use of ‘used to’ is considered old-fashioned and very formal. <br>
Nowadays, we generally use ‘did’ along with ‘use to’ in such sentences. 

Kohli ***used not to*** come here. (very formal) <br>
Kohli ***did not use to*** come here. (preferred)

Kohli ***used to*** come here? (very formal) <br>
***Did*** Kohli ***use to*** come here? (preferred)

### Concept 3

To showcase habitual action, we also use the following structure:

Pattern: verb/be + used to + $V_1$ + ing

I ***am used to working*** hard. (working - $V_1$ + ing)

I ***got used to smoking***, when I was in college.

Apart from ‘used’, there are many other words that we can use in a similar manner to showcase habitual action etc. <br>
For example: accustomed to, averse to, with a view to, addicted to, devoted to, in addition to, look forward to, object to, owing to, given to, taken to, prone to.

She is ***addicted to*** smoking.

She was ***looking forward to*** play in the district level tennis championship.

In the above case, 'to' is not a part of infinitive 'to + $V_1$'. Here 'to' is a preposition. And we know that after a preposition we use a noun/pronoun that acts as the object of that preposition. If we use a verb, the verb must be in 'V + ing' form (which is basically a Gerund, which acts as a noun).
