In this article we are going to study about the Modal Verbs. 

## What are Modals?

Following verbs are called as modal verbs or modals: <br>
can, could, may, might, will, would, shall, should, must and ought (to). 

need, dare and used (to) can also sometimes function as modal verbs. But, they may function as main verbs too. 

We use modals before ordinary verbs to express mood in a sentence.

Modals are mood maker, not sentence maker. They show the mood of the sentence. 

Mood is the feeling or attitude that the speaker/writer wants to convey, i.e. meanings such as permission, possibility, certainty and necessity.

India ***may*** win the world test series in England. (win - main verb; may – modal, which conveys the mood of possibility)

India ***can*** win the world test series in England. (win - main verb; can – modal, which conveys ability)

India ***will*** win the world test series in England. (win - main verb; will – modal, which conveys certainty)

India ***mustn’t*** win the world test series in England. (win - main verb; must – modal, which conveys lack of permission)


## Types of Modals 

On the basis of the nature and functionality of the modals, they have been classified into three categories:

* Pure modals	<br>
can-could, will- could, shall-should, may – might, must - ought to

* Semi-models (Marginals) - they are used both as modal and main verb. <br>
used to, need, dare, needn’t, daren’t

* Idiomatic Modals <br>
had + better/rather/sooner, would + better/rather/sooner


## Properties of Modals 

### Property 1

The modals can, could, may, might, shall, should, will, would, must and ought are called Defective Verbs, because some things are missing in them. 

* They can’t be made singular and plural, i.e. they do not have singular and plural forms like other verbs do. They have no –s/es in the third person singular. For example, we do no write 'cans' or 'shoulds' etc. 

* They do not have non-finite forms. That is, they do not have to-infinite form or present/past participle form. So, no to-modal or -ing or –d/ed forms. For example, we cannot write 'to-can', 'musted', 'musting' etc. So, these modals are not used to convey tense either. 

### Property 2

These modals are always followed by bare infinitives.  

For example, can work, should eat etc. (Not can to work, can working, or should eaten etc.) 

### Property 3

They form inversion/interrogation without ‘do‘.

For example, can I? must I?

### Property 4

There should be no co-occurrence, i.e. we cannot use two of these modals together. 

He ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">may will</span>*** play in this match. (incorrect)

### Property 5

We use 'not' after a modal to make it negative. 

He ***should not*** go.

I ***dare not*** say.

He ***need not*** go.

I ***could not*** attend the class. 


## Properties of Semi-Modals  

### Property 1

dare, need, used can work as modals as well as ordinary verbs. 

* When they act as modals, they take $V_1$ (bare infinitive) and maintain the rules of becoming a modal. 
* On the other hand, when they work as ordinary verbs, then they agree with the subject. That is, they can take (to + $V_1$) and change of spelling is also possible there. 

I dare say. (dare - modal) <br>
I dare to say. (dare - ordinary verb)

You need not say. (need - modal) <br>
You need to say. (need - ordinary verb) <br>
She needs to memorize these words. (needs - ordinary verb) 

<!-- He used not go. (used - modal) <br>
He used to go. (used - ordinary verb) -->

### Property 2 

‘used’ is never used as a modal in an affirmative sentence. 

Pattern: Subject + used to + $V_1$ ......... (here used is working as ordinary verb)

He used play. (incorrect; used cannot work as modal in an affirmative sentence) <br>
He used to play. (correct; used as ordinary verb)

<!-- Used he go? (correct) <br>
He used not go. (correct) <br> -->
<!-- Used he not go? (correct)  -->

### Property 3

Need is never used as a modal in an affirmative sentence. 

I need say. (incorrect; need as modal) <br>
I need to say. (correct; need as ordinary verb)

I need not say anything. (correct) <br>
Need I say anything? (correct) <br>
Need I not say? (correct)
