## Uses of One and Ones

### Concept 1

When it is clear from the context what we are talking about, then: <br>
We can use the pronoun ‘one’ instead of repeating a singular countable noun. <br>
We can use the pronoun ‘ones’ instead of repeating a plural countable noun 

'Is this your car?' 'No, mine's the white ***one***.’ (one = car) <br>
People who drink aren't the only ***ones*** vulnerable to liver failure. (ones = people)

We don't use ‘one/ones’ in place of an uncountable noun. We rather use some, any or nothing at all. 

If you require any more paper, they will bring you ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">one</span>***. (incorrect – we cannot use one/ones for uncountable noun paper) <br>
If you require any more paper, they will bring you ***<span class="mak-text-color">some</span>***. (correct)

We asked for water, but they did not had ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">one</span>***. (incorrect – we cannot use one/ones for uncountable noun water) <br>
We asked for water, but they did not had ***<span class="mak-text-color">any</span>***. (correct)

### Concept 2

We replace:

a/an + adjective + singular countable noun  → a/an + adjective + one 

some + adjective + plural countable noun  → some + adjective + ones

My shirt is dirty. I will get ***a clean one***. (a clean one = a clean shirt) <br>
These fruits have gone bad. Let’s buy ***some fresh ones***. (some fresh ones = some fresh fruits)

‘another’ is basically a merger of two words – an + other

I have seen some bad reviews of this hotel, so we should rather look for ***another one***. (another one = another hotel)

### Concept 3: Ones + Specific Information

If we are using ‘ones’, then we must provide some extra information, i.e. we can't use ‘ones’ without additional information. We need to specify which ‘ones’ we mean. For example, big ones, ones with red flowers. 

If we have no other information to offer, then we use ‘some’, instead of ‘ones’. 

Compare:

We need to buy new sheets. Let us buy ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">ones</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
We need to buy new sheets. Let us buy ***<span class="mak-text-color">saffron ones</span>*** this time. (correct) <br>
We need to buy new sheets. Let us buy ***<span class="mak-text-color">ones with stars on</span>*** this time. (correct) <br>
We need to buy new sheets. Let us buy ***<span class="mak-text-color">some</span>***. (correct)

### Concept 4: Difference between one’s / ones / once

Do not use one's in place of ones and vice-versa. 

Let's see the difference between ones, one's and once. 

One’s – it’s a possessive adjective, used to show possession <br>
Ones – it’s an indefinite pronoun, plural of ‘one’ <br>
Once – an adverb, that means - one time

How successful a person will be in life depends on ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">ones</span>*** ability to cope with failures. (incorrect) <br>
How successful a person will be in life depends on ***<span class="mak-text-color">one’s</span>*** ability to cope with failures. (correct; one’s ability – the ability that one has) 

{{% alert note %}}
We can use anyone’s instead of one’s, without changing the meaning of a sentence. For example, anyone’s ability to cope with failures.

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">One’s</span>*** bitten twice shy. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Once</span>*** bitten twice shy. (correct; once adverb)

{{% alert note %}}
We can use ‘one time’ instead of the adverb ‘once’, without changing the meaning of a sentence. For example, One time bitten, twice shy.

### Concept 5: Two uses of One's

One’s may mean two things:

* one’s as a possessive adjective, used to show possession 
* one’s as a contraction of ‘one is’

No ***one’s*** listening to you. (correct; here one’s just means ‘one is’; it Is not showing possession) <br>
No ***one is*** listening to you. (correct)

That gift is for your brother. This ***one’s*** for you. (correct; here one’s just means ‘one is’; it Is not showing possession) <br>
That gift is for your brother. This ***one is*** for you. (correct)

### Concept 6: One is Indefinite Pronoun

‘one’ is an indefinite pronoun, i.e. it refers to an indefinite thing.

So, we cannot use ‘one’ to refer to a definite person or thing, e.g. the bike, my car, or someone’s name (say Annie). In such cases, we will use ‘it’ instead of ‘one’.

Compare: <br>
"I need a comb. Do you have ***one***?" (a comb - indefinite thing, because any comb will do. He is not asking for a specific comb.) <br>
"The air conditioner stopped working. We should get ***it*** checked by a mechanic." (the air conditioner – definite thing, because we know which air conditioner we are talking about)

So, the difference between ‘one" and ‘it’ is somewhat like indefinite article ‘a/an’ and definite article ‘the’. We use ‘a/an’ for things that are indefinite or not specified, and ‘the’ for something or someone definite/specific. As you would have noticed in the examples given above - a comb, The air conditioner. 

### Concept 7: Pronoun for One

If 'one' is working as the subject in a sentence, then to refer to that subject we use:
* Possessive pronoun - one’s and 
* Objective pronoun – oneself

***One*** should do ***one's*** duty ***oneself***. <br>
***One*** should keep ***one's*** promise.

One must love ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">his</span>*** country. (incorrect) <br>
One must love ***<span class="mak-text-color">one’s</span>*** country. (correct)

### Concept 8: Question Tag

In question Tag, we use “one”. 

***One*** should keep ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">his</span>*** surroundings clean, shouldn’t ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">he</span>***? (incorrect) <br>
***One*** should keep ***<span class="mak-text-color">one’s</span>*** surroundings clean, shouldn't ***<span class="mak-text-color">one</span>***? (correct)

{{% alert note %}}
However, consider the following sentence: 

***One man*** is knocking at the door, isn’t ***he*** ?   (one – adjective; man - subject)

Here ‘one’ is only an adjective. The subject is ‘man’. So, we have used ‘he’ in the question tag, instead of ‘one’.

### Concept 9: Some more uses of ‘one’

Some more uses of ‘one’:

* In a sentence ‘one’ may just refer to the number ‘one’, of course. <br><br>
Don’t forget to get some hand towels. There’s just ***one*** in the bathroom. (here ‘one’ is not an indefinite pronoun, but rather it’s just referring to the quantity 1)

* In a sentence ‘one’ may just refer to an undetermined time in future. <br><br>
***One*** day we will be rich. (one – referring to an undetermined point in time in the future; here ‘one’ is not an indefinite pronoun)

* ‘one’ may be used to amplify something. <br><br>
Believe me, Mak is ***one*** good soldier. (here ‘one’ serves as amplification, as a synonym for ‘a great soldier’; here ‘one’ is not an indefinite pronoun)


## When not to use One/Ones 

We don't use one/ones in the following cases:

* We don't use ‘one/ones’ after ‘a’. So, we drop ‘a’. <br><br>
Have you got any lemon? I need ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">a one</span>*** for a cocktail I am serving. (incorrect) <br>
Have you got any lemon? I need ***<span class="mak-text-color">one</span>*** for a cocktail I am serving. (correct)

We can use ‘one’ after ‘a’, but there has to be an adjective in between the two. 

a + one (incorrect) <br>
a + adjective + one (correct)

I would like to buy a cake. If possible, I will get ***a big one***. (correct; big – adjective) <br>
I would like to buy a cake. If possible, I will get ***one*** with a lot of space. (correct; as we dropped the adjective ‘big’, we dropped ‘a’ too)

* We don't use ‘one/ones’ after nouns, which are used as adjectives. <br><br>
Generally I keep the tickets in my shirt pocket, but that day I put them in my ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">jeans one</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
Generally I keep the tickets in my shirt pocket, but that day I put them in my ***<span class="mak-text-color">jeans pocket</span>***. (correct)

* We prefer Possessive pronouns (mine, yours, hers, etc.), rather than Personal pronouns (my, your, her, etc.) + one/ones. <br><br>
I would really like to gift you a necklace like ***hers***.

But we often do use Personal pronoun + one/ones in informal speech.
