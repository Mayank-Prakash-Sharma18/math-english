## What are Indefinite Pronouns ?

Indefinite Pronouns refer to persons or things in a general way (and not any particular person or thing). 

It is used to tell about indefinite numbers and quantity. So, it gives an indication of uncertainty. 

E.g. both, all, some, one, none, few, little, any, many, much, more, most, half, enough, several <br>
Also these → Every/Some/No/Any + body/one/thing

***Some*** people are eccentric. <br>
***One*** should fulfil ***one’s*** duties. <br>
***None*** but fools will believe that.
