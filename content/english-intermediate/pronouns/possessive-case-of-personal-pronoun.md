'His' is used as both Possessive Adjective and Possessive Pronoun.

This is ***his*** bike. 	(Possessive Adjective) <br>
This bike is ***his***. 	(Possessive Pronoun)

'Her' is used as both Objective case and Possessive Adjective.

I gave my bike to ***her***. 	(Objective case) <br>
This is ***her*** bike. 	(Possessive Adjective) 

'Its' is used as Possessive Adjective but not as Possessive Pronoun.

## Possessive Adjectives 

Possessive adjectives are used to show possession/relation. 

my, our, your, his, her, its, their – they are Possessive adjectives because they come with a noun and modify them.

This is ***my*** bike. <br>
Those are ***your*** bikes. <br>
That is ***her*** bike.

As Possessive adjectives are formed from Pronouns, so these are also called as Pronominal adjectives.

## Possessive Pronouns 

Just like Possessive adjectives, Possessive pronouns also show possession.

E.g. mine, ours, yours, his, hers, theirs

This bag is ***mine***. <br>
Those balls are ***yours***. 


## Possessive Adjectives Vs. Possessive Pronouns

You will notice that Possessive pronoun is nothing but : Possessive Adjective + Noun

E.g. my + noun → mine ; our + noun → ours <br>
your + noun → yours <br>
his + noun → his ; her + noun → hers <br>
their + noun → theirs

Unlike possessive pronouns (e.g. ours, yours, its, hers, theirs), the possessive adjective one’s requires an apostrophe before the ‘s’. 

Also, just like other possessive adjectives (e.g. my, our, your, his, her, its, their), we need to use a noun/gerund after it. 

It seems like people no more believe in minding ***one’s*** own business.

Possessive adjective is always followed by noun or noun equivalent. It is never used without a noun.

On the other hand, Possessive pronoun can never qualify a noun (as possessive pronoun is already used in place of a noun). We will use possessive pronoun in a sentence if the noun has already been discussed in the sentence (to avoid repetition).  

Examples: <br>
This book is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">my</span>***. (incorrect; my – possessive adjective, but not followed by a noun) <br>
This is ***<span class="mak-text-color">my book</span>***. (correct; my – possessive adjective, followed by a noun ‘book’) <br>
This book is ***<span class="mak-text-color">mine</span>***. (correct; mine – possessive pronoun)

Your brother is an inspector but ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">mine</span>*** brother is a minister. (incorrect; mine – possessive pronoun, cannot qualify a noun) <br>
Your brother is an inspector but ***<span class="mak-text-color">mine</span>*** is a minister. (correct) <br>
Your brother is an inspector but ***<span class="mak-text-color">my brother</span>*** is a minister. (correct)

Some books refer both Possessive Adjectives and Possessive Pronouns as Possessive Pronouns only. As per them, there are two types of Possessive Pronouns:
* Dependent form of Possessive Pronouns, i.e. those Possessive pronouns that need a noun.
* Independent form of Possessive Pronouns, i.e. those Possessive pronouns that do not need a noun.

## More concepts related to Possessive Adjectives & Possessive Pronouns

### Concept 1: Apostrophe

In Possessive Pronouns and Possessive Adjectives, apostrophe is not used before 's’.

It is incorrect to use - your's, her’s, etc.

For example:	<br>
The leopard had a thorn in ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">it’s</span>*** foot. (incorrect; it’s is equivalent to ‘it is’) <br>
The leopard had a thorn in ***<span class="mak-text-color">its</span>*** foot. (correct)

### Concept 2: Use with to-infinitive

We can use either ‘$V_{ing}$’ or ‘to + $V_1$' after objective case of pronoun.

He forced ***me*** to leave. <br>
They requested ***her*** to sing. (here, 'her' is in objective case, and not a possessive adjective.) <br>
They wanted to hear ***him*** singing. 

But we do not use ‘to + $V_1$' after possessive adjectives. 

### Concept 3

We do not use possessive pronouns or possessive adjectives with separation, leave, excuse, mention, report, pardon, sight, favour.

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">His</span>*** separation is very painful to me. (incorrect) <br>
Separation from ***<span class="mak-text-color">him</span>*** is very painful to me. (correct)

We need ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">your</span>*** favour. (incorrect) <br>
We need a favour from ***<span class="mak-text-color">you</span>***. (correct)


## Possessive pronouns as various parts of a sentence

Possessive pronoun can work as:  

* a subject: <br>
Your life is good but ***hers*** is better. <br>
My bike is a Harley, but ***his*** is a Triumph.

* an object: <br>
She broke my heart so I broke ***hers***. 

* a subjective complement: <br>
This country is ***mine***.  

* object of a preposition: <br>
I prefer your offer to ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">her</span>***. (incorrect; we cannot compare offer and her) <br>
I prefer your offer to ***<span class="mak-text-color">hers</span>***. (correct; hers is the object of preposition ‘to’; here we are comparing two offers)
