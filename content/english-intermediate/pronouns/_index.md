## What is a Pronoun?

Pronoun - a word used instead of a Noun. 

***<span class="mak-text-color">But why should we use them? </span>***

By avoiding the repetition of a noun, we make a sentence short and beautiful. 

Have a look at the following sentences: 

Sentence without Pronoun: Alka is absent, because Alka is ill. <br>
It sounds odd. 

To improve it, we can avoid the repetition of the noun Alka. <br>
Sentence with Pronoun: Alka is absent, because ***<span class="mak-text-color">she</span>*** is ill.
