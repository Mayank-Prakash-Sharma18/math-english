## What are Interrogative Pronouns  ?

Interrogative Pronouns are used for asking questions. 

They are similar in form to relative pronouns. But the work which they do is different. 

E.g. who/whom/which/what/whose

### Concept 1

When interrogative form of a sentence starts with 'wh' family, helping verb comes before the subject. 

***Who*** are you looking for? (are – helping verb; you - subject) <br>
***What*** do you know? (do – helping verb; you - subject) <br>
***Which*** one do you want? 

### Concept 2

Interrogative Pronouns are also used to ask indirect questions.

Here 'wh' family word is used to join two sentences, and an assertive form of sentence follows the 'wh' family word. 

I do not know ***who*** drew this graffiti.

Tell me ***what*** package you want.

Here helping verb is used after the subject.

I don't know who ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">are you</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
I don't know who ***<span class="mak-text-color">you are</span>***. (correct; you – subject; are – helping verb)


## Who, Whom and Whose

Forms of who:
<img src="../../../media/pronouns/who-whom.png" alt="who and whom" style="width:90%;height:90%;">

* who - can be used as subject, object or  subject + object <br><br>
***Who*** wants to come? (who – subject, i.e. in subjective case) <br>
***Who*** did you go with? (who – object, i.e. in objective case) <br>
***Who*** did you say won the match? (who – object of the whole sentence; however it works as the subject for the verb won; ‘you’ is the subject of the verb say and the subject of the whole sentence too)

* whom - can only be used as object <br><br>
With ***whom*** did you go?  (whom - object) <br>

Nowadays the ‘objective who’ is more commonly used than ‘whom’ (especially in spoken English).

* whose -  always in possessive case <br><br>
***Whose*** bike is that? (whose – possessive case)


## What and Which 

What and Which – they do not have different forms for different cases.

They can be used as subject and object.

***What*** is that? 	 (what – subject) <br>
***What*** are you looking for? (what – object)

***Which*** is she? (which – subject) <br>
***Which*** do you prefer? (which – object)

## Uses of Interrogative Pronouns 

### Use Case 1

Who, Whom, and Whose are used only for persons.

***Who*** was hurt? (the answer is expected to be the name of some person.) <br>
***Whom*** did you see? <br>
***Whose*** is this kite? 

So, 'Whose’ cannot be used for non-living things.

This is a new element ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">whose</span>*** discovery was done by Martin Klaproth. (incorrect) <br>
This is a new element, the discovery of ***<span class="mak-text-color">which</span>*** was done by Martin Klaproth. (correct)

### Use Case 2: Uses of Whose 

'Whose' is used to find out the owner.

***Whose*** bike is this?

### Use Case 3: Whom and Who with a preposition

Whom and Who with a preposition:

We use ‘preposition + whom’ and not 'preposition + who’.

Pattern: Preposition + whom .....?

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">By who</span>*** was the Da Vinci Code written? (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">By whom</span>*** was the Da Vinci Code written? (correct)

{{% alert note %}}
If preposition is used at the end of the sentence, 'who' comes at the starting of the sentence.

Pattern: Who + ..... + Preposition .....?

***Who*** was the Da Vinci Code written ***by***?

### Use Case 4: Uses of Which 

Which is used in case of both persons and things. It implies selection from a limited number of items.

***Which*** of you has broken this chair? (which used for person) <br>
***Which*** of these keys is yours? (which used for thing)

If a choice is to be made between two or more, which is used.

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Who</span>*** is your son in the team? (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Which</span>*** is your son in the team? (correct)

### Use Case 5: Uses of What 

#### Concept 1: Used only for things

What is used for things only.

***What*** have you found? (the answer is expected to be the name of some thing.) <br>
***What*** was it all about? <br>
***What*** do you want? <br> 
***What*** did you say?

#### Concept 2

What ..... is/am/are/was/were ..... + Noun/Pronoun?  (it means the profession/employment is being enquired, and not the person)

***What*** are you? ... I am an engineer. <br>
***What*** is he? ... He is an architect.

Nowadays these are more common then the above: <br>
What do you do? <br>
What does he do?
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert note %}}
When we use ‘Who’, it means we are enquiring about the name and family of the person. <br>
Who is he? ... He is Mr. Ratan Tata.
{{% /alert %}}

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- #### Concept 3

What ..... for?  (it means ‘why’)  <br><br>

#### Concept 4

What ..... is/am/ ..... + Noun/Pronoun + like?   (it means we want a description) <br><br>
***What*** is the food ***like*** in your hostel? -->

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- #### Concept 5

What + do/does ..... + Noun/Pronoun + look like?   (it means we want to know the appearance) <br><br>
***What*** does your husband ***look like***?


### Use Case 6: Which vs. What

We use which -  when choices are clearly available. <br>
We use what -  when choices are not available.

I have three books. ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">What</span>*** do you read most? (incorrect) <br>
I have three books. ***<span class="mak-text-color">Which</span>*** do you read most? (correct)

My name is Aanya. ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Which</span>*** is yours? (incorrect) <br>
My name is Aanya. ***<span class="mak-text-color">What</span>*** is yours? (correct)
