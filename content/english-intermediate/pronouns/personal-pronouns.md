## What are Personal Pronouns? 

Personal Pronouns - they stand for the three persons. 

* I person: the person(s) speaking, e.g. I, we.

* II person: the person(s) spoken to, e.g. you.

‘You’ is used both in the singular and the plural.

* III Person: the person(s) spoken of, e.g. he, she, they, it. 

{{% alert note %}}
‘It’ denotes a thing spoken of (not a person), but it still is called a personal pronoun of the third person.

The personal pronouns of the third person are, strictly speaking, Demonstrative pronouns. We will learn about 'demonstrative pronouns' soon.

## Subjective & Objective Cases of Personal Pronouns

* We use subjective case of pronoun when the pronoun is working as a subject or subject complement.

* We use objective case of pronoun when it’s working as an object (direct, indirect or prepositional) or object complement.

Each of the personal pronouns, I, We, He, She and They, has a different form for the objective case, namely, Me, Him, Her, Us, Them. 

***You*** and ***It*** have the same form in both subjective and objective cases.

We will discuss possessive case of personal pronouns, along with possessive pronouns, in a separate article.

### Concept 1: I versus me 

It is a common mistake to use 'I' for 'me' and vice-versa, when the pronoun is connected by a conjunction (and, or) with some other word. 

Examples:

You and ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">me</span>*** are made for each other. (incorrect; me is objective case) <br>
You and ***<span class="mak-text-color">I</span>*** are made for each other. (correct; You and I – subjects in subjective case)  

My father will not allow you and <b><span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">I</span></b> to go to the market. (incorrect; I is subjective case) <br>
My father will not allow you and <b><span class="mak-text-color">me</span></b> to go to the market. (correct; you and me - objects in objective case)

### Concept 2: 'let', 'between … and’, 'but', 'except’

We use objective case after 'let', 'between … and’, 'but', 'except’.

Let ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">I</span>*** play soccer. (incorrect) <br>
Let ***<span class="mak-text-color">me</span>*** play soccer. (correct)

Between ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">she</span>*** and ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">I</span>***, there is a big age difference. (incorrect) <br>
Between ***<span class="mak-text-color">her</span>*** and ***<span class="mak-text-color">me</span>***, there is a big age difference. (correct)

Everybody but ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">he</span>*** was present for the meeting. (incorrect) <br>
Everybody but ***<span class="mak-text-color">him</span>*** was present for the meeting. (correct)

Except ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">he</span>*** everyone else was present in the party. (incorrect) <br>
Except ***<span class="mak-text-color">him</span>*** everyone else was present in the party. (correct)

The object of a preposition will always be in objective case.

### Concept 3: In case of Comparison

* When we are comparing with the Subject (which obviously will be in subjective case), then we will use pronoun in subjective case after ***as/than***.

* When we are comparing with an Object (which obviously will be in objective case), then we will use pronoun in objective case after ***as/than***.

In layman terms we can say that, a subject is compared with a subject and an object is compared with an object.

Examples:

***I*** walk faster than ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">him</span>***. (incorrect; I is in subjective case, but him in objective case) <br>
***I*** walk faster than ***<span class="mak-text-color">he</span>***. (correct; both I and he are in subjective case) 

***She*** is as good as ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">me</span>***. (incorrect; She is in subjective case, but me in objective case) <br>
***She*** is as good as ***<span class="mak-text-color">I</span>***. (correct; both She and I are in subjective case)

{{% alert warning %}}
Using the wrong case may even change the meaning of the sentence.

Examples:

Bradman likes Sachin more than ***me***. (Bradman – subject; Sachin - object) <br>
In this sentence, we are comparing with an object (i.e. Sachin), so we will use a pronoun in objective case (i.e. me). This sentence means that, Bradman likes Sachin more than he likes me. <br><br>

Bradman likes Sachin more than ***I***. (Bradman – subject; Sachin - object) <br>
In this sentence, we are comparing with a Subject (i.e. Bradman), so we will use a pronoun in subjective case (i.e. I). This sentence means that, Bradman likes Sachin more than I like him.  <br><br> 

The following sentence makes this even more clear: <br>
Bradman likes Sachin more than ***I*** do.

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- #### 'be' for comparison

We also use 'be' for comparison. 'be' talks about equality. 

{{% alert note %}}
'be' stands for is/am/are/was/were .....
{{% /alert %}}

* Pattern 1: Subjective case + be + Subjective case (here it’s a linking verb that links a subject and subjective complement.) <br>

* Pattern 2: Objective case + be + objective case.

Examples:

If ***I*** were ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">her</span>***, I would kill him. (incorrect; I is in subjective case, but her in objective case) <br>
If ***I*** were ***<span class="mak-text-color">she</span>***, I would kill him. (correct; both I and she are in subjective case) 

I want ***you*** to be like ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">she</span>***, so that you may go places in your life. (incorrect; you is in objective case, but she in subjective case) <br>
I want ***you*** to be like ***<span class="mak-text-color">her</span>***, so that you may go places in your life. (correct; both you and her are in objective case) -->

## Position of Personal Pronouns

### Concept 1: Singular form

If all the three persons or two out of three persons (in singular form) come in a single sentence → the order is 231.<br><br>
***You***, ***she*** and ***I*** shall work on this project. (231) <br>
***You*** and ***he*** have set a new record. (23) <br>
***He*** and ***I*** have finalized our presentation. (31) <br>
***You*** and ***I*** need to talk. (21)

### Concept 2: Plural form

If Pronouns are in plural form → the order should be 123. <br><br>
***We***, ***you*** and ***they*** should now leave for the airport. (123)

### Concept 3: Negative situation

If there’s a negative situation (e.g. something wrong is talked about or some mistake is being accepted) → the order is 123. <br><br>
***I***, ***you*** and ***he*** have committed this crime. (123) <br>
***You*** and ***he*** have done this blunder. (23)

### Concept 4

Let us see now what kind of objective case and possessive case pronouns we can use with them:

You, he and I should not waste ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">your</span>*** time. (incorrect) <br>
You, he and I should not waste ***<span class="mak-text-color">our</span>*** time. (correct; with 231, our should come)

You and he should not be spending ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">our</span>*** time idly. (incorrect) <br>
You and he should not be spending ***<span class="mak-text-color">your</span>*** time idly. (correct; with 23, your should come)

He and she should not waste ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">ours</span>*** time. (incorrect) <br>
He and she should not waste ***<span class="mak-text-color">their</span>*** time. (correct; with 33, their should come)
