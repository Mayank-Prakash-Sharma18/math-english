## What are Reflexive Pronouns ?

Reflexive Pronouns are ***compound personal pronouns*** working as object of a verb or a preposition, and referring to the same person or thing as denoted by the subject of the verb (i.e. subject and object of a sentence refer to the same person or thing).

Here action done by the subject turns back (reflects) upon the subject. 

Compare:

***He*** forced ***him*** to write it. ('he' and ‘him' refer to different people) <br>
***He*** forced ***himself*** to write it. ('he' and ‘himself' refer to the same person)

## How Reflexive Pronouns are made ?

Reflexive pronouns are called compound personal pronouns because we get them by adding –self or –selves to possessive case or objective case forms of personal pronouns. 

* The singular forms of reflexive pronouns are got by adding –self, e.g. myself, yourself, herself, himself, itself.

* The plural forms are made by adding –selves, e.g. ourselves, yourselves, themselves. 

I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">myselves</span>*** have done it. (incorrect) <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color">myself</span>*** have done it. (correct)

The word 'self' is sometimes used as a Noun. Basically, when 'self' is used alone/independently, it works as a noun only, and not as a pronoun. 

She cares for nothing but ***self***.

Sometimes 'themselves (or themself)' is used to avoid saying whether the subject is male or female.

It is a very risky situation that these troopers find ***themselves*** in. <br>
The first step of helping someone is to help ***themself***. 

Though 'themself' sounds like a logical singular form of 'themselves', and some people have started using it, but you should still avoid it in formal written contexts.

## Reflexive Pronouns as Object

A reflexing pronoun is generally used as an object (rather than as a subject). 

It may be an object of a verb, or that of a preposition.

He hurt ***himself***. (hurt – verb; himself – direct object of the verb ‘hurt’)

He sent ***himself*** a note. (sent – verb; himself – indirect object of the verb ‘sent’)

A house divided against ***itself*** cannot stand. (against – preposition; itself – object of the preposition ‘against’)

In the above examples, the reflexive pronouns were referring to the subject. But they may refer to non-subject elements of a sentence too. 

He reminds me of ***myself***. (me – direct object of the verb ‘reminds’; myself - referring to the direct object ‘me’)

He sent me a snap of ***myself***. (me – indirect object of the verb ‘sent’; myself - referring to the indirect object ‘me’)

That was a warning from me to ***myself***. (me – object of the preposition ‘from’; myself - referring to the prepositional object ‘me’)

#### Concept 1

Reflexive pronoun cannot be used as an object of a sentence, unless a noun/pronoun (that it is referring to) comes before it. 

Rahul will do the assignment for ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">myself</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
Rahul will do the assignment for ***<span class="mak-text-color">me</span>***. (correct)

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->

Don't get confused! 

A Reflexive pronoun can function as an object alone. But the noun/pronoun it is referring to must come before it. 

He hurt ***himself***. (himself - reflexive pronoun working alone as an object of the verb 'hurt'. It is referring to the pronoun 'He')

This is also valid for emphatic pronouns. However, unlike reflexive pronouns, emphatic pronouns cannot function as an object alone.

#### Concept 2

No matter how it functions in a sentence, a reflexive pronoun must be in agreement with the noun or pronoun, that it is used to refer to.

She started hurting ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">himself</span>***. (incorrect; she – female, himself - male) <br>
She started hurting ***<span class="mak-text-color">herself</span>***. (correct)


### Reflexive pronouns as objects of Prepositions

#### Concept 1

After a preposition of place or position we use a personal pronoun, not a reflexive pronoun: <br>
***He*** put her bat ***next to him***. (not <s>himself</s>)		<br>
***Monica*** had the gems ***with her***. (not <s>herself</s>)	

#### Concept 2

Some prepositions are very closely linked to their verbs. <br>
E.g. pleased with, be ashamed of, believe in, care about, do with, hear about, look after, look at, take care of.

In such cases, we use a reflexive pronoun when the subject and object refer to the same thing. <br>
***She*** came out of the exam hall looking ***pleased with herself***. (not <s>her</s>)

## Reflexive Pronouns and Verbs 

There are some verbs which generally take reflexive pronoun as their object, and some don’t. 

Let us study these verbs.  

### Verbs which take reflexive pronoun as object

There are some verbs which generally take reflexive pronoun as their object. 

E.g. We use reflexive pronoun after these verbs - introduce, acquit, avail, reconcile, amuse, resign, avenge, exert, apply, adapt, adjust, pride, absent, present, accustom and enjoy.

They have ***reconciled themselves*** to the inevitable doom.

You will have to ***apply yourself*** to be more creative in this task.


Some of these verbs, which take a reflexive pronoun as an object, follow a particular pattern. 

#### Avail

Avail + Reflexive Pronoun + of 

We must learn how to ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">avail of</span>*** any crisis. (incorrect) <br>
We must learn how to ***<span class="mak-text-color">avail ourselves of </span>***any crisis. (correct)
 
#### Enjoy

Pattern 1: Enjoy + Object + (No use of reflexive pronoun) <br>
Pattern 2: Enjoy + No Object + reflexive pronoun.

Everybody ***enjoys*** being with you. (object present, so no need to use reflexive pronoun) <br>

Last night, I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">enjoyed</span>*** at the party. (incorrect; no object, so reflexive pronoun needed) <br>
Last night, I ***<span class="mak-text-color">enjoyed myself</span>*** at the party. (correct)

#### Present / Absent 

Present/Absent – if they work as a verb, then we use reflexive pronoun. <br>
Present/Absent – if they work as an adjective, we do not use reflexive pronoun 

She ***absented herself*** for twenty days. (absented - verb) 

The accused has to ***present himself*** in court tomorrow. (present - verb) 

I guess Mragank is ***absent*** today. (absent – adjective, so no reflexive pronoun used; you may have noticed that here ‘absent’ is working as a subject complement.)

### Verbs which do not take reflexive pronoun as object

There are some verbs which don’t take reflexive pronouns after them. 

E.g. keep, stop, turn, qualify, bathe, move, rest, feel, relax, concentrate, sell, open, hide.

He ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">hid himself</span>*** inside the closet. (incorrect) <br>
He ***<span class="mak-text-color">hid</span>*** inside the closet. (correct)

You should ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">keep yourself</span>*** away from bad company. (incorrect) <br>
You should ***<span class="mak-text-color">keep</span>*** away from bad company. (correct)
