## This and These

'This' is singular and so it is used for a singular object/person that is placed closer. 

'These' is plural and is used for more than one object/person that are placed far.

***This*** is a dog. (dog – singular noun, so we used this) <br>
***These*** are dogs. (dogs – plural noun, so we used these)


## That and Those

'That' is singular and is used for a distant thing/person. 

'Those' is plural and is used for more than one distant thing/person.

That is a boat. (boat – singular noun, so we used that) <br>
Those are boats. (boats – plural noun, so we used those)

* 'that' and 'those' are used to avoid the repetition of a preceding noun. <br><br>
The climate of New Zealand is like ***that*** of Ireland. <br>
Indian soldiers are better trained than ***those*** of China.


## This/These versus That/Those

### Concept 1

this/these refers to something that is close and that/those refers to something that is farther away.

***This*** is more colourful than ***that***.

### Concept 2

When we refer to two things, which have been already mentioned:
* 'this/these' refers to the thing(s) mentioned in the last, and 
* 'that/those' to the thing(s) mentioned first.

Alcohol and LSD are both injurious to health; ***this*** perhaps, more than ***that***. (i.e. LSD is more injurious than alcohol)
