## What are Distributive Pronouns ?

Distributive Pronouns - they refer to persons or things ***one at a time***, i.e. considers the things/persons in a group individually.

That’s why they are always singular and are followed by a singular verb.

E.g. each, either, neither (neither is the negative of either).  

***Each*** of us will get an award. <br>
***Either*** of us may go to jail. <br>
***Neither*** of them will qualify.

In the above sentences, each, either, neither are the subject. But they can function as an object too. Consider the following example. 

"Which paint do you like, the yellow one or the violet one?" I don’t like ***either***. (either - pronoun working as object)

Some other distributive pronouns are: any, no one, none

If each, either, neither function as a subject or object in a sentence, then they are distributive pronouns. 

However, these words (i.e. each, either, neither etc.) can also function as adjectives, when they modify a noun/pronoun. Then we call them distributive adjectives. 

***Each*** of the boys should be rewarded. (Each - distributive pronoun, working as the subject) <br>
***Each*** boy should be rewarded. (Each - distributive adjective, modifying the noun 'boy') 

Also note that:

* Either, neither and each can function as adverbs too. 
* Either…or and neither…nor can function as conjunctions too.

We have covered either/neither and each in much more detail in separate articles dedicated to them.

## Properties of Distributive Pronouns 

### Concept 1: Distributive Pronouns with ‘of’

Plural Noun/Pronoun is used after 'each of/either of/neither of'.

Pattern: Either/Neither/Each + of + Plural Noun/Pronoun + Singular verb 

***Each of the boys*** has a note book. (boys – plural noun; has – singular verb) <br>
***Each of them*** is curious. (them – plural pronoun; is – singular verb) 

***Either of you*** can go and fetch the duster. <br>
***Neither of the accusations*** made by the prosecution lawyer is true. (accusations – plural noun; is – singular verb)

When each, either, neither work as Distributive Adjectives, they are followed by singular noun and singular verb.

Pattern: Either/Neither/Each + Singular Noun/Pronoun + Singular verb 

***Each girl was*** given a toffee. (girl – singular noun; was – singular verb) <br>
***Either road leads*** to the police station. (road – singular noun; leads – singular verb)<br>
***Neither claim is*** true. (claim – singular noun; has – singular verb)

### Concept 2

When the sentence starts with each of/either of/neither of, each, either, neither: <br>
* 'the' is used before the plural noun  
* Singular adjective, Singular verb and Singular pronoun are used in the latter part of the sentence.
* If there is a possessive pronoun after either/neither/each, then it will also take a singular form. 

***Each of the boys*** has ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">their</span>*** own table. (incorrect) <br>
***Each of the boys*** has ***<span class="mak-text-color">his</span>*** own table. (correct; boys – plural noun; has – singular verb; his – singular possessive pronoun)

## What are Reciprocal Pronouns ?

Reciprocal Pronouns are compound pronouns that denote mutual relationship.

E.g. 'each other' and 'one another’. 

Nicole and Justin love ***each other***. <br>
The people in Nigeria are killing ***one another***.

They are rarely separated even by a preposition. <br>
They suspects gave evidence ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">one against another</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
They suspects gave evidence against ***<span class="mak-text-color">one another</span>***. (correct)
