## What are Relative Pronouns ?

Relative Pronoun connect a clause or phrase to a noun or a pronoun. 

They are used to refer to (or relate to) the noun or pronoun coming immediately before them and give additional information about them . 

E.g. who, whom, whose, which, that, what, why, as etc.

The noun or pronoun for which a relative pronoun comes is called the Antecedent of relative pronoun.

I have found the coupon. I lost the coupon. <br>
I have found the coupon ***which*** I lost. (which – relative pronoun; coupon – antecedent noun)

Here is the car. You lent me the car. <br>
Here is the car ***that*** you lent me. (that – relative pronoun; car – antecedent noun)

The word ‘who’ does the work of a Pronoun and also that of a Conjunction (Conjunctive Pronoun). 

But we still call it a Relative Pronoun because it refers to (or relates to) antecedent noun.

<!-- ### Concept 

Never use any conjunction between the antecedent and the relative pronoun.

The ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">boy and whom</span>*** I like most is none other than your brother. (incorrect) <br>
The ***<span class="mak-text-color">boy whom</span>*** I like most is none other than your brother. (correct)

That was a wonderful ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">chance but which</span>*** you have lost. (incorrect) <br>
That was a wonderful ***<span class="mak-text-color">chance which</span>*** you have lost. (correct) -->


## Agreement of the Relative Pronoun and its Antecedent

### Concept 1

A Relative Pronoun must be of the same number and person as its Antecedent, which is a Noun or Pronoun (because a relative pronoun refers to that antecedent). 

The ***girl who was*** disobedient was punished. <br>
The ***girls who were*** disobedient were punished. 

### Concept 2

One of +  plural noun -  antecedent will be a plural noun, so it will take a plural verb 

He is one of those who ***have*** come. (here antecedent is one of those, with the plural noun ‘those’ being the main antecedent. So, plural verb used.) 

Only one of +  plural noun -  antecedent will be only one and not the plural noun, so it will take a singular verb.

He is only one of those who ***has*** come. (here antecedent is only one of those, with only one being the main antecedent. So, singular verb used.)

## Subjective, Objective and Possessive cases of Relative Pronouns

Relative pronoun always begins a new clause. This clause is called a relative clause.

In the relative clause, the relative pronoun can be in subjective, objective or possessive case.

### Concept 1

Relative Pronouns (whom/which/that) are used as an object in subordinate clause.

Pattern: Noun/Pronoun + Relative Pronoun (Object) + Subject + Helping verb + Main verb + .....

I have a daughter ***whom*** I love very much. (whom - relative pronoun and object of subordinate clause)

‘which’ and ‘that’ are used as subject as well as object.

### Concept 2

Main antecedent will never be in possessive case. Convert it into ‘of pattern’ if that is the case.

Pattern: Noun/Pronoun + Relative Pronoun + Noun/Pronoun 

I liked ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Tom's presentation</span>*** who is a technical architect. (incorrect) <br>
I like ***<span class="mak-text-color">the presentation of Tom</span>*** who is a technical architect. (correct)

But some Relative pronouns are used to express possession or relation.

The boy ***whose*** hair is long is my nephew.

## Omission of the Relative Pronoun 

We will consider two cases separately. The case where the Relative Pronoun:

* is part of the object. 

* is part of the subject.  

### When relative pronoun is an object or part of an object

The relative pronoun is generally omitted when it would be in the objective case. 

I am the king of all ***whom*** I survey. <br>
I am the king of all I survey. 

### When relative pronoun is a subject or part of a subject 

* Antecedent + Relative Pronoun (we can omit it) + Subject + Verb + ........ <br><br>
The book ***which*** I lent you is hers. <br>
The book I lent you is hers. (book – antecedent; which – omitted; I – subject)

<!-- * Antecedent + [Relative Pronoun + is/am/are/was/were] (we can omit it) + adjective/$V_3$ <br><br>
All the boys ***that are*** good at Maths can dance. <br>
All the boys good at Maths can dance. (boys – antecedent; that are – omitted; good – adjective) <br><br>
All the chairs ***which were*** broken yesterday have been repaired. <br>
All the chairs broken yesterday have been repaired. (chairs – antecedent; which were – omitted; broken – $V_3$) -->

* Antecedent + [Relative Pronoun + $V_1$ / $V_2$ /is/ am/are/was/were + $V_4$] (this can be changed into $V_4$) <br><br>
The girl ***who lives*** in California loves me the most. <br>
The girl ***living*** in California loves me the most. (girl – antecedent; ‘who lives’ replaced with ‘living’) <br><br>
The girl ***who is playing*** in shorts loves me the most. <br>
The girl ***playing*** in shorts loves me the most. (girl – antecedent; ‘who is playing’ replaced with ‘playing’)

## Position of the Relative Pronoun 

Relative pronoun comes just after its antecedent. To prevent ambiguity, the Relative Pronoun should be placed as near as possible to its Antecedent. Though there are some exceptions, e.g.  in case of structural  compulsions.

The girl was given a prize who had won the competition. (incorrect) <br>
The girl who had won the competition was given a price. (correct)

If we misplace the clause having relative pronoun, it may even change the meaning of the sentence. <br>
Compare the following sentences: <br>
The boy who had an accident is the son of my friend, Mr. Tomar. (boy had an accident) <br>
The boy is the son of my friend Mr. Tomar who had an accident. (Mr. Tomar had an accident)


## Compound Relative Pronouns

Compound Relative Pronouns are the pronouns formed by adding ever or soever to who, which and what. 
It’s generally done for providing emphasis.

E.g. whoever (i.e. any person who), whosoever; whichever; whatever, whatsoever. 

***Whoever*** comes is welcome. <br>
I will appoint ***whomsoever*** you select. <br>
***Whatever*** she does, she will face no repercussions.

<!-- ### Concept 

As these compound relative pronouns have no antecedent, we use singular verb with them.

Whoever/Whosoever ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">have</span>*** the power can play dirty. (incorrect; plural verb - have) <br>
Whoever/Whosoever ***<span class="mak-text-color">has</span>*** the power can play dirty. (correct; singular verb - has) -->
