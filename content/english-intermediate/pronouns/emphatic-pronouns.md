## What are Emphatic Pronouns?

Just like reflexive pronouns, they are also compound personal pronouns, but they are used for the sake of emphasis. 

The same words that work as reflexive pronouns, can work as emphatic pronouns too, e.g. myself, himself, herself, yourself, themselves, itself. 

She ***herself*** closed the gate. <br>
The pond ***itself*** is not very large.


### Concepts related to Emphatic Pronouns

#### Concept 1

Emphatic pronoun cannot be used as a subject or an object of a sentence, unless a noun/pronoun (that it is referring to) comes before it. 

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Himself</span>*** will go to the doctor. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">He himself</span>*** will go to the doctor. (correct; A pronoun ‘He’ comes before ‘himself’)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Themselves</span>*** managed the ship. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">They themselves</span>*** managed the ship. (correct)

Aanya and ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">herself</span>*** are doctors. (incorrect) <br>
Aanya and ***<span class="mak-text-color">she</span>*** are doctors. (correct)

This is also valid for reflexive pronouns. However, unlike emphatic pronouns, reflexive pronouns cannot function as a subject (neither alone, nor as part of a subject phrase).

#### Concept 2

No matter how it functions in a sentence, an emphatic pronoun must be in agreement with the noun or pronoun, that it is used to refer to.

The ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">boys himself</span>*** went out to play. (incorrect; boys – plural, himself - singular) <br>
The ***<span class="mak-text-color">boys themselves</span>*** went out to play. (correct)

She completed the project ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">himself</span>***. (incorrect; she – female, himself - male) <br>
She completed the project ***<span class="mak-text-color">herself</span>***. (correct)

#### Concept 3

An emphatic pronoun can be used to emphasise the subject as well as the object.  

##### Emphasising the Subject

When an emphatic pronoun emphasizes a subject, we have positional mobility. (i.e. we can move its position)

She ***herself*** cooks the food. (herself – emphasizing the subject ‘she’; it comes just after the subject) 

She came ***herself***. (herself – emphasizing the subject ‘she’; it comes after an intransitive verb ‘came’)

We made it ***ourselves***. (ourselves – emphasizing the subject ‘we’; it comes after a transitive verb ‘made’ and its object ‘it’)

She cooks the food ***herself***. (herself – emphasizing the subject ‘she’; it comes after a transitive verb ‘cooks’ and its object ‘food’)

##### Emphasising the Object

But when an emphatic pronoun emphasizes an object, we will put emphatic pronoun just after the object only.

I met Aanya ***herself***. (correct; Aanya – object; herself – emphasizing the object)

<!-- ### Some other uses of Emphatic Pronouns

We sometimes use emphatic pronouns to mean 'also’ or ‘too’. <br>
Geetu said she was feeling ill. I was feeling pretty sick ***myself***. (i.e. I too)

We also use emphatic pronouns to mean that someone is capable enough alone. <br>
They don’t need anyone’s guidance. They can do it ***themselves***. (i.e. they can do it alone)

We also use emphatic pronouns to show contrast. <br>
You support Democrats? I am a Republican supporter ***myself***. (i.e. I am in contrast with you) -->

## Differences between Reflexive Pronoun and Emphatic Pronoun

### Difference 1

While a reflexive pronoun reflects the action of the subject upon the subject itself, an emphatic pronoun just emphasizes the action of the subject. 

A reflexive pronoun answers the question : ***whom ?***

He cut ***himself***. [himself - reflexive pronoun, since the subject’s (i.e. the boy’s) action of cutting refers back to the subject/doer (i.e. the boy); cut whom? - himself]

He ***himself*** cut the tree.  [himself - emphatic pronoun, as it is just emphasizing the action of cutting done by the subject (i.e. the boy)]

In laymen’s terms, we can say that, when reflexive pronoun is used to emphasize something (i.e. noun or other pronoun) then we call it emphatic pronoun.

### Difference 2

We can drop an emphatic pronoun from the sentence, without affecting the meaning of the sentence. That’s because emphatic pronouns do not add much meaning. They just emphasize the action. 

On the other hand, if we drop a reflexive pronoun, the sentence won’t make any sense; it’s meaning would be lost.

Compare:

He ***himself*** cut the tree. (himself - emphatic pronoun; we can drop it) <br>
He cut the cake.

He cut ***himself***. (himself - reflexive pronoun; we cannot drop it) <br>
He cut.  (cut what? ... doesn’t make any sense)

### Difference 3

Unlike reflexive pronouns (that are always used as object of a verb/preposition), emphatic pronouns can be a part of subject or part of an object.

I ***myself*** heard him say that. (I myself – subject)

We can also write the above sentence as follows: <br>
I heard him say that ***myself***. (I myself – subject)

It was told so by the professor ***himself***. (professor himself – object of the preposition ‘by’)

<!-- ### Difference 4

Unlike reflexive pronouns, emphatic pronouns cannot work as an object alone.

I cured ***myself***. (myself – reflexive pronoun, acting as an object of the verb ‘cured’ all alone)

I was treated by my dad ***himself***. (himself – emphatic pronoun, which is part of the object ‘my dad himself’, i.e. it is part of the object of the preposition 'by')
