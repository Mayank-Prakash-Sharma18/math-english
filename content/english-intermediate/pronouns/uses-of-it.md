Let’s see some of the use cases of ‘it’ and ‘its’. 

{{% alert note %}}

## Uses of It and Its

We use Pronoun ‘it’ or ‘its’ for the following purposes: 

### Use 1

For non-living things

That was a nice book. ***It*** resolved all my doubts. <br>
You expect us to do something about the apocalypse; as if ***it*** is true. 

### Use 2

For animals (but not when we want to speak of them as male and female) 

The puppy fell from the staircase and broke ***its*** leg. 

### Use 3

For a young child (but not when we want to refer to the sex) 

When I saw the child ***it*** was playing in the garden. 

### Use 4

To refer to some statement that came before.

‘Work is worship’. ***It*** is a protestant ethic. 

### Use 5

As an introductory subject before the verb ‘to be’. In such cases, ‘it’ works as a provisional and temporary subject. The real subject follows later.  

***It*** is difficult to find good friends. (to find good friends – this infinitive phrase is the real subject phrase of this sentence) <br>
We can rewrite the above sentence as – To find good friends is difficult.

***It*** is doubtful whether they will teach. (whether they will teach – real subject phrase of this sentence) <br>
We can rewrite the above sentence as – Whether they will teach is doubtful.

***It*** is clear that you are cheating. (that you are cheating – real subject phrase of this sentence) <br>
We can rewrite the above sentence as – That you are cheating is clear.

So, we can often use ‘it’ to begin a sentence, instead of an infinitive clause, gerund clause, that-clause, or whether-clause.

So, if a sentence starts with ‘it’ followed by any form of 'be’, then the real subject will follow. This subject can be a noun, noun phrase or a pronoun, and it must be in ‘subjective case’. 

It is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">me</span>*** who am to blame. (incorrect; me - Objective case) <br>
It is ***<span class="mak-text-color">I</span>*** who am to blame. (correct; I - Subjective case)

### Use 6

As an impersonal pronoun.

***It*** happens. <br>
***It*** thunders. <br>
***It*** bites. 

In the above sentences, the pronoun ‘it’ seems to stand for no noun. But the noun it stands for can be supplied by the verb and the context. For example, ‘It bites’ may mean ‘The dog bites.’

When we use ‘It’ in such a manner, it is called an Impersonal Pronoun. And the verb (e.g. happens, thunders, bites etc.) is called an Impersonal Verb. 

### Use 7

We sometimes use 'It' as a subject to put emphasis on the noun or pronoun following it. 

***It*** was she who ditched me. (‘It’ putting emphasis on ‘she’)

***It*** was at Copenhagen that the climate treaty was signed. (‘It’ putting emphasis on ‘Copenhagen’)

<!-- ### Use 8

We also use ‘it’ to talk about condition of something, the weather or the time.  

***It*** is fine. <br>
***It*** is autumn. <br>
***It*** is nine o'clock.  -->

## Its vs. It’s

***Its***: Possessive form of ‘it’. To be more precise, it is a possessive adjective. We use it to show possession/relation. 

***It’s***: Abbreviated form of ‘It + be’, i.e. It is / It was / It has

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">It’s</span>*** beauty beggars description. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Its</span>*** beauty beggars description. (correct)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Its</span>*** a long way to the castle. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">It’s</span>*** a long way to the castle. (correct)


## It and They/Them 

The plural forms of 'it’ are:
* They (in subjective case)
* Them (in objective case)

{{% alert note %}}
‘It’ is the singular form for both subjective and objective cases.

'Their' is the plural of 'Its'.

## This vs. It

Now, let us have a look at a few differences between 'This' and 'It’.

### Difference 1

We use ‘This’ (instead of ‘It’):

* to point towards a singular person or thing placed at a near distance. <br>
***This*** is an amoeba.

* for the introduction of a person. <br>
***This*** is Anand, my cousin.

### Difference 2

'It' denotes distance/time/weather etc. We do not use 'this' for such purposes.

***It*** is 9 a.m. <br>
***It*** is noon here in Delhi. <br>
***It*** is spring.

<!-- ### Difference 3

As ‘It’ is a pronoun, so we cannot use a noun after it. However, we can use a noun after ‘This’.

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">It car</span>*** is mine. (incorrect; car – noun) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">It</span>*** is my car. (correct; car – noun) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">This car</span>*** is mine. (correct; car – noun) -->
