## Adjectives as plural common noun

When we use 'the' before an adjective, it may become a plural common noun. So, we use plural verb with it.

The poor ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">is</span>*** better than the rich. (incorrect) <br>
The poor ***<span class="mak-text-color">are</span>*** better than the rich. (correct; are – plural verb)

Blessed ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">is</span>*** the ignorant. (incorrect) <br>
Blessed ***<span class="mak-text-color">are</span>*** the ignorant. (correct; are – plural verb)

We should never look down upon the ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">poors</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
We should never look down upon the ***<span class="mak-text-color">poor</span>***. (correct)

We should not use a noun after the + adjective’s.

Incorrect pattern: The + Adjective’s + Noun 

Correct pattern: The + Noun + of + the + Adjective

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">The poor’s plight</span>*** is very pathetic in Africa. (incorrect)

***<span class="mak-text-color">The plight of the poor</span>*** is very pathetic in Africa. (correct; here ‘is’ has been used because the subject of the sentence is plight)

## Adjectives as singular noun 

When we use 'the' before an adjective, it may become a singular noun denoting some abstract quality.

He is a lover of ***the beautiful***. (i.e. beauty in general)


## Adjectives that actually become nouns

Some adjectives actually became nouns. So, we can use them in singular, as well as plural forms. 

Here are some of such adjectives working as noun:

* Those derived from proper nouns: Indians, Italians.
* Some denoting persons: juniors, seniors, mortals, inferiors, superiors, nobles, criminals, savages, elders, minors.
* A few denoting things generally: secrets, totals, liquids, solids, valuables.
