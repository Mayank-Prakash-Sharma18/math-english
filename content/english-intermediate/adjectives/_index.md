## What is an Adjective?

Adjective is a word used to qualify nouns and pronouns, i.e. it adds something to their meaning.

E.g. He is a ***brave*** boy. (boy – noun; brave - adjective)

It may describe or point out a noun, or tell the number or quantity. 

Aanya is a ***beautiful*** girl. (beautiful – describes the noun ‘girl’) <br>
You need to submit your form at ***that*** counter. (that – points out the noun ‘counter’) <br>
He gave me ***three*** medals. (three – tells the number of nouns, i.e. ‘medals’) <br>
We got ***little*** time to prepare ourselves. (little – tells about the amount of noun, i.e. ‘time’)

## How to identify an adjective?

We can identify an adjective using various methods:

### By definition

Adjective is such a qualifying word that tells the quality of a noun/pronoun. 

E.g. ***poor*** boy, ***long*** thread etc.

### By formation

If anyone of these suffixes is at the end of a word, then that word is most probably an adjective:

-able, -ish, -ic,  - noun + ly,  -ent, -al, -ful,  -ous,  -ive, -like/some

E.g. It is ***injurious*** to you. (injurious - adjective)

### By placement

As an adjective modifies a noun/pronoun, it is generally placed:

* just before that noun/pronoun. <br><br>
Pattern: Adjective + Noun/Pronoun <br><br>
E.g. ***many*** girls, ***all*** boys, ***pawn*** shop etc.

* after a linking verb, if it is functioning as a subjective complement. <br><br>
Pattern: Noun/Pronoun + linking verb + Adjective (Subjective Complement) <br><br>
E.g. He is ***cruel***. (cruel - adjective)
