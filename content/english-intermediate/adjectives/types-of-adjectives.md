In this sub-module, we will have a look at the various types of Adjectives, based on their functioning in a sentence. 

## Adjectives of Quality 

Adjectives of Quality (or Descriptive Adjective) - show the kind or quality of noun (i.e. that of a person, place or thing).

Adjectives of Quality answer the question : <strong>Of what kind?</strong>

E.g. shape, size, colour,  mental state, physical state, social status, judicious quality.

She is a ***graceful*** lady. (lady of what kind? - graceful) <br>
London is a ***large*** city. (city of what kind? - large) <br>
***Red*** carpet was laid for the Prime Minister. (carpet of what kind? - red)

Adjective of quality can end with:
 
-like (childlike), -ish (childish), -ic (altruistic), -able (amiable), -ous (fabulous), -ful (beautiful), -less (careless), -ory (savory), -ile (servile), -ate (legitimate), -ing (pleasing), -ed (pleased)

### Proper Adjectives 

Proper Adjectives - These are the Adjectives formed from Proper Nouns.

E.g. Indian tea, African diamonds, Italian mafia, Buddhist monastery, Hindu temple, British rule etc. 

They are generally classed with Adjectives of Quality.


## Adjectives of Quantity 

Adjectives of Quantity - show how much of a noun is.

Adjectives of Quantity answer the question: <strong>How much?</strong>

E.g. some, all, any, a lot, lots of, much, little, a little, the little, all, enough, ample, whole, sufficient, abundant, great, a great deal of, colossal, enormous, half.

Do you have ***some*** sugar? <br>
He displayed ***much*** resilience. <br>
There are ***sufficient*** funds in the trust to take care of ***all*** stray dogs in the locality.


## Adjectives of Number 

Adjectives of Number (or Numeral Adjectives) - show how many nouns are meant, or in what order nouns stand.

Adjectives of Number answer the question: <strong>How many?</strong>

E.g. no, all, many, some, most, several, cardinal numbers (two, five etc.), ordinal numbers (first, third etc.).

I have ***three*** watches. (three – cardinal adjective) <br>
Monday is the ***first*** day of your office. (first – ordinal adjective) <br>
I have learned ***many*** things from her. <br>
***Most*** men indulge in unnecessary flirting.

### Types of Adjectives of Number

Adjectives of Number are of three kinds:

* Definite Numeral Adjectives

* Indefinite Numeral Adjectives

* Distributive Numeral Adjectives

#### Definite Numeral Adjectives 

Definite Numeral Adjectives denote an exact number.

* Cardinals (or cardinal adjectives) - denote ‘how many’. <br>
E.g. one, two, three, etc. 

* Ordinals (or ordinal adjectives) – denote the ‘order of things’ in a series. <br>
first, second, third, etc.

##### Article ‘the’ and Definite Numeral Adjectives

###### Concept 1

Article 'the' is used before Ordinal but not before Cardinal.

The ***third*** act of Merchant of Venice is pretty awesome. <br>
Act ***three*** revolves around Shylock.

###### Concept 2

When both Ordinals and Cardinals come together in a sentence, then we place ordinals first and then the cardinals. That is, the order is 'OC’. 

Pattern: The + Ordinal + Cardinal 

We will have PT in ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">the two last</span>*** periods. (incorrect) <br>
We will have PT in ***<span class="mak-text-color">the last two</span>*** periods. (correct)

What have you done on ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">the three first</span>*** days of your holiday? (incorrect) <br>
What have you done on ***<span class="mak-text-color">the first three</span>*** days of your holiday? (correct)

{{% alert note %}}
We often use this pattern: the +  ordinal + to + $V_1$
 
I was ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">the last for entering</span>*** the exam hall. (incorrect) <br>
I was ***<span class="mak-text-color">the last to enter</span>*** the exam hall. (correct)
{{% /alert %}}

#### Indefinite Numeral Adjectives

Indefinite Numeral Adjectives do not denote an exact number.

E.g. all, many, few, some, any, certain, several, sundry.


#### Distributive Numeral Adjectives

Distributive Numeral Adjectives refer to each one of a noun.

E.g. each, every, either, neither. 

***Each*** girl must get her vaccination. <br>
***Every*** Indian should know his Fundamental Duties. <br>
***Either*** explanation can be printed. <br>
***Neither*** solution seems effective.

<!-- ##### Distributive Numeral Adjectives Vs. Distributive Pronoun 

* Distributive Adjective – when each, every, either or neither are immediately <strong>followed by noun</strong>, then they function as Distributive Adjective.

* Distributive Pronoun – when each, every either or neither are <strong>followed by some other word</strong>, then they function as Distributive Pronoun.

### Relationship between Adjectives of Quantity and Adjectives of Number

Depending on how an adjective has been used in sentence, it may function either as adjective of quantity or adjective of number.

## Demonstrative Adjectives 

Demonstrative Adjectives point out which person or thing is meant. 

Demonstrative Adjectives answer the question: <strong>Which ?</strong>

E.g. this, that, these, those, such etc.  (these are adjectives when they are used with nouns)

***This*** car is mine. <br>
***That*** bike is yours. <br>
***These*** apples are mine. <br>
***Those*** oranges are yours. <br>
I love ***such*** gestures.

### Concept 1

‘this’ and ‘that’ are the only adjectives which are inflected (i.e. their form is changed) to show number.

* this, these - indicate something(s) near to the speaker.

* that, those - indicate something(s) more distant from the speaker.

***This*** boy seems depressed. <br>
***These*** boys seem depressed.

***That*** boy knows his potential.	<br>
***Those*** boys know their potential.

## Concept 2

this, that, these or those are:

* demonstrative adjectives, if immediately followed by a noun. <br><br>
***This*** game is good. (this - demonstrative adjective; game - noun) <br>
***That*** mic is new. (that - demonstrative adjective; mic - noun)

* demonstrative pronouns, if immediately followed by other parts of speech, e.g. a verb. <br><br>
***This*** is a good game. (this - demonstrative pronoun) <br>
***That*** is a new mic. (that - demonstrative pronoun)

<br><hr><br>

## Interrogative Adjectives

Interrogative Adjectives are used with nouns to ask questions.

E.g. what, which and whose.

***What*** kind of a software is it? <br>
***Which*** computer language will you use for your new app? <br>
***Whose*** website is this?

### Concept

what, which, whose are:

* interrogative adjectives, if immediately followed by a noun. <br>
***What*** size is your shirt? (what - interrogative adjective; size - noun)

* interrogative pronouns, if immediately followed by other parts of speech, e.g. a verb. <br>
***What*** is the size of your shirt? (what - interrogative pronoun)

<br><hr><br>

## Emphasizing Adjectives

Emphasizing Adjectives are used to emphasize something.  

E.g. ‘the same’, own and very.

It is ***the same*** ball that we lost yesterday. <br>
He saw the murder with his ***own*** eyes. <br>
This is the ***very*** necklace I want.

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- ### Concept

While using ‘own’, keep in mind that own (as an adjective) must be preceded by:

* a possessive adjective (my, our, your, his, her, their, its, one's) or 
* a noun with an apostrophe (i.e. noun in possessive case), e.g. Sehwag's own bat. 

Pattern: possessive adjective/noun in possessive case +  own (adjective) +  noun
 
I do ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">own</span>*** work. (incorrect) <br>
I do ***<span class="mak-text-color">my own</span>*** work. (correct; my - possessive adjective)

{{% alert note %}}
He ***owns*** a Labrador. (here own is not an adjective but a verb)
{{% /alert %}} -->

<br><hr><br>

## Exclamatory Adjective

Pattern: what + a/an + noun ....!

***What*** an idea! <br>
***What*** a blessing!

<br><hr><br>

## Possessive Adjectives

We have already studied Possessive Adjectives in the module on Possessive case of Personal Pronouns.

Here let us see a few more of their properties. 

### Concept 1

Possessive adjectives comes after 'All' and 'Both' and not before them. 

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">My all</span>*** books have got lost. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">All my</span>*** books have got lost. (correct; my – possessive adjective)

### Concept 2

In case of the following words, we don’t use possessive adjective.

excuse, pardon, favour, separation, leave, mention, etc.

Did he make ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">my mention</span>***? (incorrect) <br>
Did he make a ***<span class="mak-text-color">mention of me</span>***? (correct)

He can’t stand ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">your separation</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
He can’t stand the ***<span class="mak-text-color">separation from you</span>***. (correct)

<br><hr><br>

## Distributive Adjectives

Distributive Adjectives - each, every, either and neither

### Concept 1

When used as Adjectives, they are followed by singular nouns. Also, with them we use singular verbs and singular pronouns. 

Pattern: each, every, either, neither +  singular noun + singular verb and singular pronoun

***Each*** student should submit his assignment. (student – singular noun; his – singular pronoun) <br>
***Neither*** accusation is true. (accusation – singular noun; is – singular verb)

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- {{% alert note %}}
If each, either, neither function as adjectives, they modify a noun/pronoun. Then we call them distributive adjectives. 

However, these words (i.e. each, either, neither etc.) can also function as a subject or object in a sentence. Then they are distributive pronouns.

***Each*** of the girls should be rewarded. (Each - distributive pronoun, working as the subject) <br>
***Each*** girl should be rewarded. (Each - distributive adjective, modifying the noun 'girl') 

Note that, ***Every*** can only function as an adjective, not as a pronoun. 
{{% /alert %}} -->

### Concept 2

Consider the following pattern:

Pattern: Each/Every + Singular noun + and + each/every + Singular noun + Verb + Pronoun

Here the pronoun will be according to the latter subject.

Each boy and every girl was doing ***her*** work. (we used her as the latter subject is girl)

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- ### Concept 3: Every as Distributive adjective

Every - one in a collection of three or more. We never use it in a group of two. 

It is not a pronoun. It is a distributive adjective and a determiner. 

***Every*** boy is doing his work.

#### Concept 3a

As every is not a pronoun, we cannot use it alone. It is an adjective and we need to use a noun (or pronoun) along with it. 

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Every</span>*** has a mobile phone. (incorrect; noun/pronoun is missing) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Every one</span>*** has a mobile phone. (correct)

#### Concept 3b

Also, we cannot say every of (like we say each of, either of), because every is not a pronoun. -->
