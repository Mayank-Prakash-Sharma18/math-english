In this article we will study how various types of Adjectives are formed. 

There are three types of Adjectives, based on the degree of comparison: 

* Positive degree
* Comparative degree
* Superlative degree

Let's start with the Adjectives of Positive degree. 

## Formation of Adjectives of Positive degree

Adjectives are formed from:

* Nouns
* Verbs
* Other Adjectives

### Adjectives formed from Nouns

Many Adjectives are formed from Nouns.

### Adjectives formed from Verbs

Some Adjectives are formed from Verbs.

## Formation of Comparative and Superlative Degrees of Adjective

Now, let us understand how Comparative and Superlative Degrees of Adjective are formed. 

### Adjectives of one syllable

In most Adjectives of one syllable (and some of more than one), we add:
* ***er*** in the positive degree to form the Comparative degree and 
* ***est*** in the positive degree to form the Superlative degree.

But there are various exceptions to this general rule.

#### Exception 1

When the adjective of positive degree ends in e, only r and st are added.

#### Exception 2

When the adjective of positive degree ends in 'y', preceded by a consonant, the 'y' is changed into 'i' before adding 'er' and 'est'.

If a vowel is present before 'y', only 'er' and 'est' should be added.

<!-- #### Exception 3

When the adjective of positive degree is a word of one syllable and ends in a ***single*** consonant, preceded by a ***short vowel***, this consonant is doubled before adding 'er' and 'est'.

Short vowel refers to the vowel that occurs individually between consonants (i.e. in the pattern Consonant-Vowel-Consonant), e.g. pet, sad etc.

<!-- #### Exception 4: Irregular Comparison

Comparative and Superlative forms of some Adjectives are formed irregularly (and not from the positive form of the adjective).

### Adjectives of two or more syllables

To form the Comparative and Superlative degrees of adjectives of ***two or more*** syllables, in general we put ***more/less*** and ***most/least*** before the positive form.

<img src="../../../media/adjectives/formation-of-adjectives8.png" alt="formation of adjectives" style="width:90%;height:90%;">

Adjectives with two syllables that are only used (or are most commonly used) with more/less and most/least are:

* participle adjectives, i.e. two-syllable adjectives ending in ing or ed (e.g. pleased, worried, boring, surprised) 

* two-syllable adjectives ending in -ful and -less (e.g. careful, useful, careless, hopeless)

* many other two-syllable adjectives (e.g. afraid, alike, alert, ashamed, alone, aware; cautious, certain, complex, confident, eager, exact, famous, foolish, formal, frequent, modern, recent)

But as usual, there are exceptions to this too. In fact, most other adjectives with two syllables (than those listed above) can take two forms.

<!-- #### Exception

Some adjectives can take either 'er' and 'est' OR more/less and most/least.

Here’s a list of such adjectives: cruel, common, feeble, gentle, polite, simple, narrow, handsome, pleasant, stupid.
	
Aanya is ***politer/more polite*** than Mragank.

Meenakshi is the ***politest/most polite*** of them.

A Caveat: 

When we compare two qualities of the same person, we always use 'more + adjective' (and not their comparative or superlative degree)

He is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">luckier</span>*** than laborious. (incorrect) <br>
He is ***<span class="mak-text-color">more lucky</span>*** than laborious. (correct)

## Adjectives without comparative or superlative forms

There are certain adjectives that cannot be compared. So, these adjectives do not have comparative or superlative forms.

For example: square, round, circular, perfect, excellent, eternal, universal, unique, extreme, major, minor, equal, interior, exterior, ulterior, empty, excellent, chief, entire, complete, final, last, triangular, eternal, everlasting, ideal, absolute, impossible and supreme. 

These adjectives already have a comparative or superlative meaning. So, they are rarely used with -er/-est or more/less/most/least. 

This is a case of ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">most extreme</span>*** malnutrition. (incorrect) <br>
This is a case of ***<span class="mak-text-color">extreme</span>*** malnutrition. (correct)

She is the ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">most unique</span>*** character in this movie. (incorrect) <br>
She is a ***<span class="mak-text-color">unique</span>*** character in this movie. (correct)

This headset is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">more inferior</span>*** to that. (incorrect) <br>
This headset is ***<span class="mak-text-color">inferior</span>*** to that. (correct)

### Exceptions

We know that a thing cannot be more square, more round, more perfect. But there are some exceptions where we do use them. 

For example:

All ministers are equal but some ministers are ***more equal*** than others.

This is the ***most perfect*** specimen I have seen. 


## Adjectives used in only positive and superlative degree 

Some adjectives only have positive and superlative degrees. They do not have a comparative degree form.

Let’s see some of these adjectives.
