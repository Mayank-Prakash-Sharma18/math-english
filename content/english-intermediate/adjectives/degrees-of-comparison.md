## What are Degrees of Comparison?

We change the form of Adjectives to show comparison.

E.g.  bright, brighter, brightest.

These forms of an adjective are called Degrees of Comparison.

## Types of Degrees of Comparison

There are three degrees of comparison: 

* Positive degree
* Comparative degree
* Superlative degree


## How to use various degrees of Adjectives?

### Positive Degree 

The Positive Degree of an Adjective - the Adjective in its simple/base form. 

It can be used to denote existence of some quality in one, two or more than two things/persons. It is generally used when no comparison is made.

Let’s see the sentence structures that we witness in sentences having a positive degree adjective.

#### Sentence Structure 1

Pattern: Subject + Verb + Positive degree adjective

Your mom’s curry was ***delicious***. 

#### Sentence Structure 2

Between 'as ... as' and ‘so ... as’, we use the positive degree of adjective/adverb.

Pattern: Subject + Verb + as/so + Positive degree adjective (or positive degree of adverb) + as + Noun/Pronoun

She is as ***beautiful*** as her mother. (beautiful - adjective) <br>
He bowls as ***fast*** as Brett Lee. (fast - adverb)

Positive degree adjective can be used for comparison when we talk about:
* equality of two persons/things (i.e. when both are equal; no one is more or less than the other) or 
* inequality of two persons/things.

This girl is as ***tall*** as that boy. <br>
My toys are as ***good*** as yours. <br>
My resume is not so ***great*** as yours. 

{{% alert note %}}
We can use as...as in both affirmative and negative sentences, but so...as can only be used in negative sentences.

##### Related Concepts

###### Concept 1

Sometimes both positive and comparative degree of an adjective are used in a single sentence. In such case we will use the positive degree adjective with 'as ... as' and 'so ... as' and comparative degree adjective with 'than’.

He is ***as strong as***, if not ***more than***, his cousin.

###### Concept 2

We can use the word ‘equally’ in place of ‘as ... as’, but not both of them together.

Incorrect pattern: Subject + Verb + equally as + Positive degree adjective + as + ... <br>
Correct pattern: Subject + and + Subject + Verb + equally + Positive degree adjective + ... 

Mr. Mehta is equally as ***handsome*** as Mr. Robert. (incorrect) <br>
Mr. Mehta is as ***handsome*** as Mr. Robert. (correct) <br>
Mr. Mehta and Mr. Robert are equally ***handsome***. (correct)

#### Sentence Structure 3

Pattern: No other +  singular noun +  singular verb + as/so +  positive degree + as +  noun/pronoun
 
No other boy is as/so ***good*** as he. <br>
(no other makes the sentence negative,  so we can use either as...as or so....as)

##### Use with 'other'

Compare these two sentences: <br>
No method is as ***easy*** as this method. (incorrect) <br>
No other method is as ***easy*** as this method. (correct)

To know more about the usage of 'other' for comparison purposes, <a href="/english-intermediate/adjectives/degrees-of-comparison/#sentence-structure-2-use-with-other" title="Use with 'other'">read this section of the article</a>.

#### Sentence Structure 4

Pattern: Very few +  plural countable noun +  plural verb + as/so +  positive degree + as +  noun/pronoun
 
Very few men are as ***good*** as he.

#### Sentence Structure 5

Comparative degree adjective never comes with enough. Instead, with enough we use the Positive degree adjective. 

Pattern: positive degree adjective + enough + [to + $V_1$] (infinitive)

Shakuntala Devi is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">smarter enough</span>*** to unravel this Zodiac puzzle. (incorrect) <br>
Shakuntala Devi is ***<span class="mak-text-color">smart enough</span>*** to unravel this Zodiac puzzle. (correct)

I am ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">older enough</span>*** to do this job. (incorrect) <br>
I am ***<span class="mak-text-color">old enough</span>*** to do this job. (correct) 

Uncle Scrooge McDuck is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">enough rich</span>*** to buy out small countries. (incorrect) <br>
Uncle Scrooge McDuck is ***<span class="mak-text-color">rich enough</span>*** to buy out small countries. (correct)


### Comparative Degree 

The Comparative Degree of an Adjective denotes a <strong>higher degree of the quality than the Positive</strong>.

It is used when two things/persons (or sets of things/persons) are compared.  

Nikita’s artwork is ***better*** than Nicole's.

{{% alert note %}}
There are a couple of ways in which we can compare things/persons using Comparative degree. 

Compare the following sentences:

Nikita’s artwork is ***better*** than Nicole’s. (correct) <br>
Nicole's artwork is ***worse*** than Nikita’s. (correct)

Andy is ***stronger*** than Dwight. (correct) <br>
Dwight is ***weaker*** than Andy. (correct)

We can even use positive degree instead of comparative degree: <br>
Dwight is ***less strong*** than Andy. (correct; strong – positive degree of adjective)

Let’s see the sentence structures that we witness in sentences having a comparative degree adjective. 

#### Sentence Structure 1

Pattern: Subject +  Verb + comparative degree adjective + than/to/of +  noun/pronoun

This girl is ***taller*** than that boy.

A comparative degree adjective is generally followed by ‘than’. But comparative degree adjectives ending in -or are followed by the preposition ‘to’.

For example: inferior, superior, prior, anterior, posterior, senior, junior. 

This book is ***inferior to*** the standard book I already have. <br>			
He came here ***prior to*** his brother's death. <br>
All officers in this office are ***senior to*** you.

{{% alert note %}}
These adjectives can also be used as nouns. <br>
You must respect your ***seniors***.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert note %}}
‘different’ is also used for comparison. But it takes ‘from’ and not ‘to/than’. <br>
Your son seems to be ***different from*** you. 
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert warning %}}
When two or more adjectives are used in a sentence and they take different preposition, we should use appropriate preposition for them.

Donald is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">senior and better than</span>*** Jack. (incorrect) <br>
Donald is ***<span class="mak-text-color">senior to and better than</span>*** Jack. (correct)

This ring is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">superior and more expensive than</span>*** that one. (incorrect) <br>
This ring is ***<span class="mak-text-color">superior to and more expensive than</span>*** that one. (correct)

#### Sentence Structure 2: Use with 'other'

In case of comparison in the same group, we use ‘other’ after no/all/any in case of adjectives of  positive/comparative degree (but not in case of adjectives of superlative degree). 

Pattern 1: Subject + Verb + comparative degree adjective + than +  any other +  singular noun 

He is ***better*** than any other boy.

The Times of India is better than ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">any</span>*** newspaper. (incorrect; better – comparative degree) <br>
The Times of India is better than ***<span class="mak-text-color">any other</span>*** newspaper. (correct)

If one metal is compared with all the others of the same variety, we use 'any other' to exclude the metal being compared.

Lithium is less dense than ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">any</span>*** metal. (incorrect – because we are comparing an item to other items of the same variety, i.e. one metal with other metals) <br>
Lithium is less dense than ***<span class="mak-text-color">any other</span>*** metal. (correct)

Pattern 2: Subject + Verb + comparative degree adjective + than +  all other +  plural noun 

He is ***better*** than all other boys.

{{% alert note %}}
It is necessary to put 'other' if the adjective is of comparative degree. We need not put it in case of superlative degree.

{{% /alert %}}

#### Sentence Structure 3

Pattern: Subject + Verb + comparative degree adjective + than + most other +  plural noun

She is ***more intelligent*** than most other students.

{{% alert note %}}
'Than' may or may not come after a comparative degree.

But if ‘than’ comes, then it will come after the comparative degree adjective.

She is ***better than*** her mother.

Pattern 2: Comparative degree adjective + <s>than</s> <br>
I am feeling ***better***.

{{% /alert %}}

You should either use positive degree of the adjective or drop Comparatively/Relatively/Preferably

#### Sentence Structure 5: Use of Prefer and Preferable

##### Concept 1: Preferable

Adjective 'preferable' is used only in comparative degree.

'Preferable' is followed by 'to' and not 'than’. Also we do not use 'more/most’ before it.

Moreover, there a few more fine details that you should keep in mind while using sentences with 'prefer'. Let's study some of such concepts. 

Pattern 1: Subject + (would) + prefer + (to + $V_1$)+ rather than + ($V_1$ / <s>to + $V_1$</s>)

### Superlative Degree 

The Superlative Degree of an Adjective denotes the highest degree of the quality, and is used when more than two things/persons (or sets of things/persons) are compared.

{{% /alert %}}

Various possible sentence structures with adjectives of superlative degree:

#### Sentence Structure 1

Pattern: Subject + Verb + the + superlative degree adjective + Noun

He is the ***best*** boy.

Sometimes, these words are also used - among/amongst/in/of. <br>

#### Absolute Superlative

We sometimes us the Superlative degree adjectives with 'most' to indicate the possession of a quality in a very high degree (and not for comparison per se).

When an adjective of superlative degree is used in such a manner, then it called the Superlative of Eminence, or the Absolute Superlative.

It was a ***most eloquent*** speech. <br>
This is ***most unfortunate***.

## Comparatives used as Positive

### Comparative meaning lost

Some Comparative degree adjectives have lost their comparative meaning and are now used as Positive degree adjectives. 

E.g. former, latter, elder, upper, inner, outer, utter.

They are not followed by ‘than’. 

The thieves ran to jump over the ***outer*** wall. <br>
My ***elder*** sister is a doctor. <br>
This kid is an ***utter*** fool.

### Latin adjectives

Certain comparative degree adjectives borrowed from Latin act like positive degree adjectives. They all end in 'or' (not 'er'). 

These are five in number: interior, exterior, ulterior, major, minor.

How he got here is a matter of ***minor*** importance. <br>
I am not helping you out with any ***ulterior*** motive in mind.

<br><hr><br>

## Interchange of the Degrees of Comparison

We can change the degree of comparison of an adjective in a sentence, without changing the meaning of the sentence. 	

Let’s see some examples:

Hydrogen is the ***smallest*** of all atoms. (smallest – Superlative degree) <br>
Hydrogen is ***smaller*** than all other atoms. (smaller – Comparative degree)

Interstellar is the ***best*** science fiction movie. (best - Superlative degree) <br>
Interstellar is ***better*** than any other science fiction movie. (better - Comparative degree) <br>
No other science fiction movie is so ***good*** as Interstellar. (good - Positive degree)

<br><hr><br>

## Can we use two comparative OR two superlative degrees together? 

Two comparative degree adjectives can never come together. <br>
Similarly, two superlative degree adjectives can also never come together.

He is the ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">most bravest</span>*** of all the soldiers. (incorrect) <br>
He is the ***<span class="mak-text-color">bravest</span>*** of all the soldiers. (correct)

Your answer is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">more better</span>*** than his answer. (incorrect) <br>
Your answer is ***<span class="mak-text-color">better</span>*** than his answer. (correct)

However, we can use two positive, two comparative OR two superlative degrees together, if those adjectives are connected by a conjunction. 

### Conjunctions connecting Adjectives 

If two adjectives connected by a conjunction are <strong>used for a single noun or pronoun</strong>, then both the adjectives must be in same degree.

Subhash Chandra Bose was the bravest and ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">able</span>*** of all the freedom fighters. (incorrect) <br>
Subhash Chandra Bose was the bravest and ***<span class="mak-text-color">ablest</span>*** of all the freedom fighters. (correct)

Some more examples:

He is a ***smart and handsome*** boy. <br>
He is ***more beautiful and fairer*** than me. <br>
She is the ***cleverest and tallest*** girl. <br>
He is as ***tall and fair*** as his brother.

#### Connecting Adjectives using 'and' 

If you join er/est/more/most  pattern with the help of and, we use the following pattern (only in case of comparative and superlative degrees):

Pattern: er/est + and + more/most 

(i.e. single syllable adjectives followed by double syllable adjectives)

He is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">more intelligent and cleverer</span>*** than Jo. (incorrect) <br>
He is ***<span class="mak-text-color">cleverer and more intelligent</span>*** than Jo. (correct)

#### Connecting Adjectives using 'but', 'if not'

We can also join the adjectives of different degree with the help of ‘but’ or ‘if not’. 

He is as clever as ***but*** more intelligent than Andy. <br>
She is short ***but*** the most beautiful girl. <br>
He is as strong as ***if not*** taller than Dwight.

### Use of determiner with more than one Adjective

When two or more adjectives are used for ***one person or thing***, we use determiner before the first adjective only. 

She is ***my*** witty and ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">my</span>*** gorgeous wife. (incorrect) <br>
She is ***my*** witty and gorgeous wife. (correct)

But there are a few exceptions to this rule. We use determiner with both the adjectives in the following cases:

#### Exception 1

either ... or / neither ... nor / not only ... but also / or / both   

#### Exception 2

When the two adjectives have different sounds (i.e. consonant and vowel sound) 

You are both ***an*** intelligent and ***a*** diligent guy.
