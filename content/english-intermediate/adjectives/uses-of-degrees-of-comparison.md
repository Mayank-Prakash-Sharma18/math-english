In this article we will study the various uses of Degrees of Comparison of Adjectives. Also, we will have a look at the common errors students make while using these adjectives. 

## To show Increase / Decrease

### Gradual Increase / decrease

In case of gradual Increase / decrease, use the following structures. <br>
Pattern 1: ...... + get/become + Comparative degree adjective + and + Comparative degree adjective

Our English is getting ***<span class="mak-text-color">better and better</span>*** with each passing day. (correct)

In his old age a man is likely to get ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">more weak</span>*** by the day. (incorrect) <br>
In his old age a man is likely to get ***<span class="mak-text-color">weaker and weaker</span>*** by the day. (correct)

Pattern 2: ...... + get/become + more and more + Positive degree adjective 

We are becoming ***more and more*** diligent.

### Parallel Increase / decrease

In case of parallel increase and decrease, we use the following structure. <br>
Pattern: The + Comparative degree adjective + Subject + Verb + ............ + the + Comparative degree adjective + Subject + Verb + ....... 

The more electricity we use, ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">higher</span>*** the bill will be. (incorrect) <br>

## Use of ‘the’ with superlative and comparative degree 

### Use of ‘the’ with superlative degree adjectives

We generally use ‘the’ before a superlative degree.

E.g. the latest, the best etc. 
 
This kind of skirt is ***the*** latest fashion. <br>
It’s true as per ***the*** latest news.

{{% alert note %}}
‘most’ can be used in two ways:

* as  superlative degree it means the most. Here we use 'the most'. <br>
He is ***the most*** intelligent boy.

* it may be used to mean a large number. Here we  do not use 'the most’. <br>
***Most*** of the boys in this class are intelligent.

Note: Mostly - it means generally, or in general case. 
{{% /alert %}}

### Use of ‘the’ with comparative degree adjectives

In comparative degree we generally do not use 'the',  except in these cases:

* in case of selection <br><br>
Out of these two kids, this one is ***the*** taller. <br>
Which one of these two is ***the*** better gaming station?

* The +  Comparative degree adjective +  Subject + Verb + the +  Comparative degree adjective ... <br><br>
***The*** more we get ***the*** more we want.

* The +  Comparative degree adjective + the +  Comparative degree adjective <br><br>
***The*** more ***the*** merrier. (idiomatic expression) <br>
***The*** more ***the*** better. (idiomatic expression)

### Making a choice

#### Concept 1

When one is chosen out of two, we use the following pattern:

Pattern: the + comparative degree adjective + of

He is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">the best of</span>*** two pilots. (incorrect) <br>
He is ***<span class="mak-text-color">the better of</span>*** two pilots. (correct)

#### Concept 2

When one is chosen out of 'more than two' or ‘all’, we use the following pattern:

Pattern: the + superlative degree adjective + of 

He is ***the best of*** the three umpires. <br>
He is ***the best of*** all the umpires.

## Comparing two qualities in the same person or thing 

When we need to compare two qualities in the same person or thing (i.e. noun/pronoun), then we do not use the –er form of comparative degree. 

Instead of the comparative degree adjective, we use ‘more/less + positive degree adjective’.

Pattern: more/less + Positive degree adjective + than + Positive degree adjective

Compare the following sentences:

Mragank is ***taller than*** Mayank. (same quality of two persons being compared) <br>
Mragank is ***more*** brave ***than*** prudent. (two qualities of the same person are being compared)
