Position of an adjective can change the meaning of the whole sentence.

Compare the following sentences:

A ***great*** king's son should live up to the reputation. 

A king's ***great*** son should live up to the reputation. 

So, we need to keep in mind where we are placing the adjective in a sentence.  


## Types of Adjectives based on their position

Based on their position, Adjectives can be of two types:

* Attributive Adjective and 

* Predicative Adjective 

### Type 1: Adjective used attributively

Attributive Adjectives are the adjectives used along with the noun as an attribute.

It can of two types:

* Adjective just before a noun

* Adjective just after a noun

#### Type 1a: Adjective just before a noun

Pattern: Adjective + Noun 

E.g. yellow rose

The ***tallest*** boy was made the basketball team captain. (tallest – adjective; boy - noun)

We met a ***genius*** scientist. (genius – adjective; scientist - noun)

#### Type 1b: Adjective just after a noun

They are also known as ***Postpositive adjectives***. 

Pattern: Noun/Pronoun + Adjective

E.g. attorney general, nothing new, something spicy

The watches, ***available*** here are of low quality. (watches - noun;  available -  adjective)

The woman ***in red saree*** is my wife. (woman - noun; in red saree -  adjective phrase)

The book, ***which was published last month***, is a potboiler. (book -  noun; which was published last month - adjective clause)

##### Some examples of Postpositive adjectives

Some classes of adjectives that fall in this category are: 

###### Example 1 

Some -ible and -able adjectives: e.g. available, imaginable, possible, suitable. 

However, we use these adjectives immediately after a noun ***only*** when:

* the noun follows words such as first, last, next, only and superlative adjectives. <br>
It is the only treatment ***suitable***. (or ...the only suitable treatment.)

* or when a prepositional phrase follows the adjective. <br>
Pattern: Noun + Adjective + Prepositional Phrase <br>
This is a benefit ***available*** to employees only. 

###### Example 2

In certain phrases the Adjective always comes immediately after the noun:

For example: heir apparent, time immemorial, lord paramount, viceroy elect, letters patent, knights temporal, notary public, body politic, God Almighty.

<!-- ###### Example 3

When some word or phrase is joined to the Adjective to explain its meaning, the Adjective is placed after its noun:

She was a businesswoman ***fertile*** in resource. (fertile – adjective; in resource – prepositional phrase)

A soldier, ***taller*** than any of his comrades, attacked the enemy line. (taller – adjective; than any of his comrades - phrase)

###### Example 4

When several Adjectives are attached to one noun they are sometimes placed after it for emphasis.
		
The lieutenant, ***hurt*** and ***anguished***, advanced towards the enemy. -->


### Type 2: Adjectives used predicatively 

Predicative Adjective is an adjective that is used after linking verb as subjective complement. 

Such an adjective is always part of the predicate (and not of the subject).  That’s why we call it Predicative Adjective. 

Pattern: Noun/Pronoun + Verb + Adjective 

The manager is ***smart***. (manager – subject; is – verb; smart – adjective working as subjective complement)

These cities are ***vulnerable to violence***. (These cities -  subject; are – verb; vulnerable to violence -  adjective phrase working as subjective complement)

<!-- {{% alert note %}}
All adjectives that are part of a predicate need not be predicative adjective. Even attributive adjectives can be part of the predicate.

We saw a ***beautiful*** horse. (beautiful – attributive adjective, which is part of the predicate; horse - noun)

## Adjectives that can be used attributively or predicatively

The same adjective can function as attributive adjective and predicative adjective in different sentences. Let’s see some examples:

## Adjectives that are used only attributively 

Some adjectives are seldom or never used after a linking verb, i.e. they never work as predicative adjectives. 

For example: we say – “This is a medical emergency.” <br>
But we don’t say – “This emergency is medical.”

Some classes of adjectives that fall in this category are: 

* Classifying adjectives: atomic, cubic, digital, medical, phonetic; chief, entire, initial, main, only, whole; eventual, occasional, northern (etc.), maximum, minimum, nuclear, underlying. <br><br>
The ***main*** issue is that of the buggy software. <br>
The ***underlying*** assumption behind this projection is faulty.

* Emphasizing adjectives: absolute, complete, mere, utter <br><br>
Joining that company will prove to be an ***absolute*** harakiri of your career.


## Adjectives that are used only predicatively

Some Adjectives can be used only as Predicative adjectives.

Pattern: Noun + Linking Verb + Adjective

Some classes of adjectives that fall in this category are: 

* Some adjectives starting with ‘a’: afraid, alight, alike, alive, alone, ashamed, asleep, awake, aware <br><br>
***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Afraid</span>*** Pam is of ghosts. (incorrect) <br>
Pam is ***<span class="mak-text-color">afraid</span>*** of ghosts. (correct; afraid - predicative adjective)

* Some adjectives describing health and feelings: content, fine, glad, ill, poorly, sorry, (un)sure, upset, (un)well <br><br>
I am quite ***well***. (well – predicative adjective)

However, these words can sometimes be used between an adverb and a noun. Here they function as attributive adjective. 

E.g. I am catering to a terminally ***ill*** patient. (terminally – adverb; ill – adjective; patient - noun)
