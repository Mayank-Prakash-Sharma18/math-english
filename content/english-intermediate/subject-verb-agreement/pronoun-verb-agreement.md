## Relative Pronoun - Verb Agreement

If a relative pronoun joins a subject and the verb, then the verb will agree with the antecedent to the relative pronoun.

Pattern: Subject + Relative pronoun + Verb (will agree with antecedent)

He is one of the cruelest ***men*** that ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">has</span>*** ever ruled this kingdom. (incorrect) <br>
He is one of the cruelest ***men*** that ***<span class="mak-text-color">have</span>*** ever ruled this kingdom. (correct; men – antecedent to the relative pronoun ‘that’)

{{% alert note %}}
Some relative pronouns are: that, who, which, etc.

## Possessive pronouns

In case of possessive pronouns (mine, yours, ours, hers, etc.), the verb will be used according to the noun present in them.

## Neither of, Either of, None of etc.

We prefer to use singular verb with ‘any of’, ‘each of’, ‘either of’, ‘neither of’, or ‘none of’ and a plural noun.

## Neither … or, Either … or etc.

### Number of subjects joined by ‘or’, ‘nor’

Number (singular/plural) of subjects joined by ‘or’, ‘nor’ and the verb to be used:

#### Concept 1

When we connect two or more singular subjects by ‘or’ or ‘nor’, we use a singular verb.

Either Aanya or Alka ***has*** the ring. <br>
Neither option A nor option B ***seems*** to be the correct answer. <br>
No nook or corner ***has*** been left unexplored.

#### Concept 2

When one of the subjects joined by ‘or’ or ‘nor’ is plural, we use a plural verb. Keep in mind that in such a case, the plural subject should be placed nearest to the verb.

Neither the President nor the ministers ***were*** invited.

### Person of subjects joined by ‘or’, ‘nor’

Person (first/second/third) of subjects joined by ‘or’, ‘nor’ and the verb to be used:

#### Concept

When the subjects joined by ‘or’ or ‘nor’ are of different persons, the verb agrees with the nearer subject.

Either she or I ***am*** going to be the captain.	<br>	
Neither you nor she ***is*** going to be the captain.

But there is a better way to write this. We can avoid these constructions and rephrase them as follows: <br>
She is going to be the captain, or else I am.	<br>	
She is not going to be the captain, nor are you.	

{{% alert note %}}
In general, we can say that if two subjects are joined by 'neither .... nor', 'either ... or', 'or', the verb will agree with the nearest subject (in number and person).

The same is true for: 'not only … but also', 'nor', 'none-but'.

Neither David nor his friends have come. (friends – plural subject; have – plural verb)
{{% /alert %}}


## Each, Every, One, etc.

### Concept 1

These are singular:
* Words beginning with every-, some-, any- and no- , i.e. every/some/no/any + body/one/thing <br>
E.g. Each, Every, Everyone, Someone, Somebody, Nobody, None, Any, Nothing 
* One
* Many a
* More than one 

So, we use singular verb, singular noun and singular pronoun with them.

Each employee ***has*** come. (employee – singular noun; has – singular verb) <br>
Every house ***has*** its own parking. (house – singular noun; has – singular verb)

Every boy, girl, man, and woman ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">are</span>*** capable of doing anything. (incorrect) <br>
Every boy, girl, man, and woman ***<span class="mak-text-color">is</span>*** capable of doing anything. (correct; is – singular verb)

{{% alert note %}}
As already mentioned, when indefinite pronoun 'One' is the subject of a sentence, then we use singular verb and singular pronoun.

The pronouns we use here are: one, one's, and oneself (and not 'he', 'him', 'his' or 'himself).

One should keep ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">his</span>*** temper in check. (incorrect) <br>
One should keep ***<span class="mak-text-color">one's</span>*** temper in check. (correct)

One must learn from one's friend as well as ***<span class="mak-text-color">one's</span>*** enemy. (correct)
{{% /alert %}}

Let us see some more patterns when using ‘each’ and ‘every’:

When we qualify two nouns by ‘each’ or ‘every’, and connect them by ‘and’, we still use a singular verb.

Pattern 1: Each/Every + singular noun + and + each/every + singular noun + singular verb

Every nurse and every doctor ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">were</span>*** notified about this virus scare. (incorrect) <br>
Every nurse and every doctor ***<span class="mak-text-color">was</span>*** notified about this virus scare. (correct)

Each student and each teacher ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">are</span>*** responsible for this. (incorrect) <br>
Each student and each teacher ***<span class="mak-text-color">is</span>*** responsible for this. (correct)

Have a look at the following pattern too.

Pattern 2: Each and every + singular noun + ........ + singular verb 

Each and Every policeman present in this room ***has*** been charged with corruption. (policeman – singular noun; has – singular verb)

If we use 'each' after plural noun/pronoun, then we use plural verb. We encounter the following patterns:

Pattern 1: Plural noun/pronoun + each + plural verb 

We each ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">does</span>*** everything correctly. (incorrect) <br>
We each ***<span class="mak-text-color">do</span>*** everything correctly. (correct; We – plural pronoun; do – plural verb)

Pattern 2: Plural noun/pronoun + plural helping verb + each + main verb

They ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">each have</span>*** decided to leave India for good. (incorrect) <br>
They ***<span class="mak-text-color">have each</span>*** decided to leave India for good. (correct; They – plural pronoun; have – plural helping verb; decided – main verb)

{{% alert note %}}
Here “each” is used just for additional information. 
{{% /alert %}}

### Concept 2

If we use 'of’ after each, every, one, etc. then we witness the following pattern:

Pattern: each/every/one + of + plural noun/pronoun 

That is, the noun/pronoun that comes immediately after 'of’ will be plural in form. 

However the verb, pronoun, adjective, etc. that comes in the latter part of the sentence will be singular in form. 

One of the students/them ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">have</span>*** completed ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">their</span>*** assignment. (incorrect) <br>
One of the students/them ***<span class="mak-text-color">has</span>*** completed ***<span class="mak-text-color">his</span>*** assignment. (correct; students/them – plural noun/pronoun; has – singular verb; his – singular pronoun)

Let us see some more patterns that we encounter when we use 'of’ after one.

Pattern 1: One of + plural noun + relative pronoun + plural verb + .... + singular verb 
(plural verb comes for plural noun)

One of the books which were written by you is laying on the table. (books – plural noun; were – plural verb; is – singular verb)

relative pronouns - who/which/that/as/but
{{% /alert %}}

Pattern 2: Subject + verb + one of + plural noun + relative pronoun + plural verb <br>

This is one of the best novels that ***<span class="mak-text-color">have</span>*** appeared this year. (correct; novels – plural noun; have – plural verb)
