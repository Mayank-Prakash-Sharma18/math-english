In this article, we will focus on the cases where a noun (or multiple nouns) acts as the subject. So, we will study how different noun forms agree with the verb. 

## Nouns plural in form but singular in meaning

### Rule 1

With nouns which are plural in form but singular in meaning – We use singular verb.

Let us see some of such nouns:

* Names of countries: The United States, The West Indies, etc.

* Names of games: Billiards, Darts, Draughts, etc.

* Name of diseases: Measles, Mumps, Rickets, Shingles, etc.

* Names of books: The Arabian Nights, Three Muskeeters, etc.

* Names of subjects: Physics, Economics, Civics, Statics, Politics, Linguistics, etc.

Mathematics ***is*** a difficult subject to master. (is – singular verb)

{{% alert note %}}
If 'Statistics' means 'data', 'Mathematics' means ‘calculations' and 'Politics' means ‘political thoughts', then we will use a plural verb.

Statistics ***have*** revealed multiple issues in the upcoming project. (have – plural verb)
{{% /alert %}}

### Rule 2

Proper name for some single object or some collective unit (even if it’s plural in form) – it is followed by a singular verb.

The ***Arabian Nights*** is my favorite movie. (is – singular verb)

The ***United States*** has won the soccer championship. (has - singular verb)

### Rule 3

Some noun phrases with a plural form (denoting some specific quantity or amount) are thought of as a whole, and so we use singular verb with them. 

For example, Noun phrases referring to:
* measurements (e.g. a certain distance, a certain period of time), 
* amounts (e.g. a certain amount of money) and 
* quantities (e.g. a certain weight).

Pattern : Number + Noun in plural form + Singular verb 

Ten kilometers ***is*** a very long distance for me. <br>
Three days ***is*** not long enough for a holiday. <br>
Three thousand rupees ***is*** a big amount for a boy like me. <br>
Three parts of the work ***is*** left for me to do. <br>
The fifty pounds he gave me ***was*** not enough.


## Nouns singular in form but plural in meaning 

With nouns which are singular in form but plural in meaning – We use plural verb.

Let us see some of such nouns:

cattle, cavalry, infantry, poultry, peasantry, children, gentry, police and people. ('s' is never used with these nouns.)

***Cattle*** are grazing in the field. <br>
***Police*** have registered an FIR.

{{% alert note %}}
‘People’ means ‘a number of men’ while ‘peoples’ means ‘people of different races’.

The German ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">peoples</span>*** are very industrious. (incorrect; Here we are talking about only one race. Therefore the use of ‘peoples’ is wrong.) <br>
The German ***<span class="mak-text-color">people</span>*** are very industrious. (correct)

## Nouns same in singular and plural form

Some nouns are same in singular and plural form. 

For example: deer, sheep, series, species, fish, crew, aircraft, counsel etc.

India has imported twenty aircraft this year.  

There are twenty fish in the fish pond. (fish – plural meaning; are – plural verb)

{{% alert note %}}
Fishes can also be used. Fishes is used to refer to multiple species of fish. 
{{% /alert %}} 


## Nouns which exist only in plural form

Some nouns exist only in plural form (we cannot remove 's' from such nouns to make then singular) – We use plural verb with them. 

For example: scissors, tongs, pliers, pincers, bellows, trousers, pants, pajamas, shorts, spectacles, goggles, binoculars, sunglasses, gallows, fangs, alms, amends, archives, arrears, auspices, congratulations, embers, fireworks, lodgings, outskirts, particulars, proceeds, regards, riches, remains, savings, shambles, surroundings, tidings, troops, tactics, thanks, valuables, wages, belongings, braces, shoes, socks, glasses, whereabouts etc.

The ***proceeds*** were given to animal charities. (were – plural verb)

Where are my ***Pants***? (are – plural verb)

{{% alert note %}}
Wages can be used in both singular & plural form. 

Compare the following sentences: <br>
Workers' wages ***are*** to be paid in cash. (wages – compensation for labour; are – plural verb) <br>
Wages of hard work ***is*** sweet. (wages – result; is – singular verb)
{{% /alert %}}

We can make these nouns singular by using them with ‘a pair of’. 

Pattern 1: A pair of + those having two parts + singular verb 

<!-- A pair of shoes ***were*** standing in the corner. <br> -->
A pair of shoes ***was*** standing in the corner.

But if we use ‘pairs of’ with nouns that have two parts, we use a plural verb.  

Pattern 2: Pairs of + pair nouns having two parts + plural verb 

Many pairs of scissors ***have*** been bought for you.


## Foreign words

With singular form of foreign nouns we will use singular verb and with their plural form we will use plural verb. 

Singular and plural forms of some of such nouns have been listed below.

There is a number of criteria of selecting candidates. <br> 
There are a number of criteria of selecting candidates. 

The bacteria you are talking about is highly hazardous.

Do you know this data is highly useful. -->


## Collective nouns

With Collective nouns we generally use singular verb (when we see it as a group/unit).

The herd of cows ***is*** moving towards the river. (herd – collective noun, singular noun; is – singular verb) 

The committee ***has*** decided to reverse its decision. (committee – collective noun, singular noun; has – singular verb)

But when we talk about the members of the collective noun or when there is a division among the members of the collective noun, then we use plural verb and plural pronoun.

The committee ***are*** divided in ***their*** opinion. (are – plural verb; their – plural pronoun)

We also encounter the following patterns with collective nouns:

**Pattern 1**: A + collective noun + of + plural noun + singular verb 

A team of scientists ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">have</span>*** been invited to meet the President. (incorrect) <br>
A team of scientists ***<span class="mak-text-color">has</span>*** been invited to meet the President. (correct; has – singular verb)

**Pattern 2**: A + collective noun + of + plural noun + relative pronoun + plural verb + singular verb (singular verb – for collective noun; plural verb – for plural noun)

A crowd of people who are from Goa ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">are</span>*** waiting for you. (incorrect) <br>
A crowd of people who are from Goa ***<span class="mak-text-color">is</span>*** waiting for you. (correct)


## Plural numbers

With plural numbers we always use plural verb.

Thirty boys ***are*** in my group. (are – plural verb)

There ***are*** thirty boys in my group. (are – plural verb)

But there are a few exceptions to this rule. 

### Exception 1 

If plural noun is used after cardinal adjectives (one, two, three, four, etc.) – We will use singular verb

Hundred rupees ***is*** not a big amount. (is – singular verb)

### Exception 2

If plural noun denotes certain amount, weight, height or period – We will use singular verb.

Twenty miles ***is*** not a distance you can travel on foot. (is – singular verb)

## Uncountable nouns

With uncountable nouns we use singular verb. 

**Some Uncountable Nouns**: poetry, bread, brick, evidence, equipment, scenery, milk, soap, filth, machinery, furniture, ice, stationary, news, information, work, cutlery, traffic, advice, stone, crockery, grass, luggage, baggage, percentage, knowledge, dirt, dust, electricity, music, breakage, confectionery, pottery, bakery, behaviour, hair, business, mischief, wastage, money, jewellery, fuel, cost, word (when used in sense of message and promise) 

These nouns will not take article ‘a/an', 'many', 'few', 'number of’ and plural form.

These days news ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">are</span>*** travelling very fast. (incorrect) <br>
These days news ***<span class="mak-text-color">is</span>*** travelling very fast. (correct; news- uncountable noun; is – singular verb)

{{% alert note %}}
Monies (plural of money) means amounts of money.

Monies ***have*** been collected and handed to the orphanage. (have – plural verb)
{{% /alert %}}

We know that uncountable nouns have no plural form. 

But we can make their countable singular/plural form by adding certain words before these uncountable nouns, e.g. piece / bar / cake / slice / loaf / kind / article / strand / item etc.

Along with these, we also use ‘a/an', 'many', ‘few’, ‘some’, 'number of’, etc.

My informer has provided me ***a piece of*** information. <br>
***Many kinds of*** furniture are available here. <br>
I want ***a few articles of*** jewellery. <br>
We are in dire need of ***some items of*** office stationery. <br>
She ate ***four slices of*** bread.

Pattern 1: a piece/bar/cake/slice/loaf/kind + of + uncountable noun + singular verb

Many a piece of information ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">have</span>*** been imparted so far. (incorrect) <br>
Many a piece of information ***<span class="mak-text-color">has</span>*** been imparted so far. (correct; has – singular verb)

Pattern 2: pieces/bars/cakes/slices/loafs/kinds + of + uncountable noun + plural verb

Many bars of soap ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">has</span>*** been bought for you. (incorrect) <br>
Many bars of soap ***<span class="mak-text-color">have</span>*** been bought for you. (correct; have – plural verb)

There ***<span class="mak-text-color">are</span>*** a number of slices of bread on the table. (correct; are – plural verb)


## Nouns connected by ‘and’

### Rule 1

Two subjects joined by 'and‘ – We will use plural verb.

Ross ***and*** Rachel ***are*** getting married. (are – plural verb)

#### Exception

Two nouns qualified by ‘each’ or ‘every’, even though connected by ‘and’ – We will use singular verb.

Every boy ***and*** every girl ***was*** examined for COVID-19. (was – singular verb)

### Rule 2

Two uncountable nouns (discussing two different subjects) joined by 'and' – We will use plural verb.

Poverty ***and*** misery come together. (come – plural verb; poverty, misery – uncountable nouns)

### Rule 3

Two or more than two nouns or adjectives joined by 'and' (discussing only one person or thing or idea) – We will use singular verb.

My friend, philosopher and guide ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">have</span>*** come. (incorrect) <br>
My friend, philosopher and guide ***<span class="mak-text-color">has</span>*** come. (correct; one person being discussed)

Slow and steady ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">win</span>*** the race. (incorrect) <br>
Slow and steady ***<span class="mak-text-color">wins</span>*** the race.  (correct; one idea being discussed)

### Error of Proximity

Error of Proximity – When the verb agrees with the nearest subject.

Instead, we should match the verb with the main subject of the sentence.

Compare the following sentences: <br>
***He*** and not his friends ***is*** the culprit. (he - main subject, which is singular) <br>
His ***friends*** and not he ***are*** the culprit. (his friends - main subject, which is plural)

Some more examples:

The ***quality*** of articles ***is*** good. (quality – main subject, which is singular)

Your ***suggestion*** to discontinue the use of plastic cups ***has*** been considered. (suggestion - main subject, which is singular)

### Placement of Article

#### Rule 1

If two nouns are used, but only one article is placed before the 1st noun, it means both the nouns are used for the same person/thing – We will use a singular verb.

Putin ***is*** a great orator and ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">a great</span>*** politician of his time. (incorrect) <br>
Putin ***is*** a great orator and politician of his time (correct)

***A*** black and white dog ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">were</span>*** bought by him. (incorrect) <br>
***A*** black and white dog ***<span class="mak-text-color">was</span>*** bought by him. (correct; was – singular verb)

#### Rule 2

If two nouns are used, and an article is placed before each noun, it means both the nouns are referring to different persons/things – We will use a plural verb.

***The*** director and villain ***has*** come. (the same individual is both the director and villain; has – singular verb) <br>
***The*** director and ***the*** villain ***have*** come. (director and villain are different individuals; have – plural verb)


## singular subject + with, as well as, etc

Other subjects joined to the first subject by ‘with’, ‘as well as’, etc., are parenthetical – We use a verb which agrees with the first subject 

Pattern: $Subject_1$ + with/as well as etc. + $Subject_2$ + Verb as per $Subject_1$

Words joining the two subjects: 'with', ‘without’, 'as well as', 'along with', 'together with', 'and not', ‘in addition to', 'but', 'besides', 'except', 'rather than', 'accompanied by', 'like', 'unlike', 'no less than', 'nothing but‘, ‘led by’, ‘accompanied by’, ‘governed by’.

The train, with its passengers, ***was*** lost. (train – singular subject; with its passengers - parenthetical phrase; was – singular verb)

Justice, as well as mercy, ***allows*** it. (Justice – singular subject; as well as mercy - parenthetical phrase; allows – singular verb)

Riches and not your character ***win*** you respect in this country. (Riches - plural subject, which means wealth; and not your character - parenthetical phrase; win – plural verb)

### Concept 5

When we need to give importance to an adjective, we place it at the start of the sentence. Verb will be as per the subject.

Great ***<span class="mak-text-color">are</span>*** the thoughts of Mr. Bose. (correct)

### Concept 6

When we need to give importance to an adverb, we place it at the start of the sentence. 

Let us see a couple of such patterns. 

Pattern 1: Adverb / Adverbial phrase + auxiliary verb + subject + main verb  (auxiliary verb will be as per the subject)

Always ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">has</span>*** they tried to sabotage our project. (incorrect) <br>
Always ***<span class="mak-text-color">have</span>*** they tried to sabotage our project. (correct) 

Pattern 2: Adverb of place + auxiliary verb + main verb + subject (auxiliary verb will be as per the subject)

At the gate ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">is</span>*** standing your parents. (incorrect) <br>
At the gate ***<span class="mak-text-color">are</span>*** standing your parents. (correct)

Under the tree ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">were</span>*** sitting Krishna with his cow. (incorrect) <br>
Under the tree ***<span class="mak-text-color">was</span>*** sitting Krishna with his cow. (correct)

{{% alert note %}}
Let us see how we are supposed to find out the adverb of place. <br>
If you ask ‘Where’ from a verb, then the answer will be adverb of place <br>
Where + verb = Adverb of Place

For example, consider the following sentence:

At the gate ***are*** standing your parents. <br>
If you ask ‘standing where?’, the answer will be ‘At the gate’. 
{{% /alert %}}

### Concept 7

With uncountable nouns we use 'Amount of/Quantity of’ followed by a singular verb.

The amount of money ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">are</span>*** not sufficient. (incorrect) <br>
The amount of money ***<span class="mak-text-color">is</span>*** not sufficient. (correct; money – uncountable noun; is – singular verb)

## Common Subject

Consider the following sentence: <br>
Being sick, I could not study.  (correct)

Let us analyze the sentence: <br>
I could not study – subject is ‘I’

Being sick - the subject is not mentioned before 'being', so subject 'I' of the second part of the sentence becomes the common subject of both the parts. It’s absolutely fine as both predicates are talking about the same person. 

Consider another sentence: <br>
Being a rainy day, I could not go to school.  (incorrect)

Let us analyze the sentence: <br>
I could not go to school – subject is ‘I’

Being a rainy day - the subject is not mentioned before 'being', so subject 'I' of the second part of the sentence becomes the common subject of both the parts. But it makes no sense, as “I being a rainy day” is absurd. 

The correct subject of the first  part of the sentence is ‘It’ and it should be mentioned explicitly.

It being a rainy day, I could not go to school.  (correct)

If we need two forms of a verb in a sentence, we must use both of the forms.

## Hypothetical sentences

Hypothetical sentence – A sentence that states an imaginary position. It starts with if, as if, as though, suppose, I wish, in case, would that etc. 

In such hypothetical sentences we use the verb 'were‘ (not ‘was’) irrespective of the number of the subject.

I wish, I ***<span class="mak-text-color">were</span>*** rich. (correct)
