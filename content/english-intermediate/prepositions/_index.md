## What is a Preposition?

Preposition - a relating word placed before a noun/pronoun, and shows the relation of that noun/pronoun with something else.

So, basically a preposition establishes a relationship between two words or phrases. 

The noun/pronoun or noun equivalent which comes after a preposition is the object of that preposition. It is in objective case and is governed by that preposition. 

There is a bear ***in*** the garden. (in – preposition; garden – a noun, which is the object of the preposition)

A box fell ***on*** him. (on – preposition; him – a pronoun, which is the object of the preposition)

## Functions of Prepositions

Prepositions can do two things:

### Function 1

Prepositions can connect other words to a noun/pronoun

It depends ***on*** the cost. (here the preposition ‘on’ links the noun ‘the cost’ with the verb ‘depends’)

### Function 2

Prepositions can add idea of time, place and movement to noun/pronoun.

Meeting is ***on*** Wednesday. (idea of time added to the noun ‘meeting’)

The boxer sat ***in*** the corner. (idea of place added to the noun ‘boxer’)

He moved ***towards*** the door. (idea of movement added to the pronoun ‘he’)

## Different types of Prepositional Objects

Preposition always takes an object. Let us see the types of objects a preposition can take. 

### Object is a Noun/Noun equivalent

He is talking ***to*** my father. (to – preposition; father – noun, prepositional object)
	
### Object is a Pronoun

If Pronoun comes after Preposition then that pronoun is in objective case.

She is sending a parcel ***for*** me. (for – preposition; me - pronoun in objective case, prepositional object)

### Object is a Gerund

If verb comes after preposition, then that verb is in -ing from (i.e. Gerund).

You can’t prevent me ***from*** going there. (from – preposition; going - gerund) 

We also see the following pattern:

preposition + Ving form of verb + noun/pronoun (objective case)

She is very good ***at*** mesmerizing people. (at – preposition)

### Object is an Adverb of time or place 

It will be over ***by*** then. (by – preposition; then – adverb of time) 

***Since*** then he has not talked to me. (since – preposition; then – adverb of time) 

Move away ***from*** there. (from – preposition; there – adverb of place)

### Object is an Adverbial Phrase

She had not met him ***till*** a few days ago. (till – preposition; a few days ago – adverb phrase)

### Object is a clause

Pay careful attention ***to*** what I am going to say. (to – preposition; what I am going to say – clause)

## Special cases

### Prepositions with multiple Objects

A Preposition may have two or more objects.

The road runs over ***hill*** and ***plain***. (over – preposition; prepositional objects – hill, plain)

### Omission of Objects

When object to a preposition is a relative pronoun, it is sometimes omitted.

He is the criminal we were looking for. (Here ***whom*** is understood; for - preposition)

We can rephrase the sentence as: He is the criminal ***whom*** we were looking for. 

### Omission of Prepositions

The prepositions for, from, in, on, of, to, after etc. are often omitted.

Wait a minute. (for – omitted preposition; minute – noun of time) <br>
We can rephrase it as - Wait for a minute. 

Where have you been? (to – omitted preposition) <br>
We can rephrase it as – Where have you been to? 

Having eaten my dinner I went to sleep. (After – omitted preposition) <br>
We can rephrase it as - After having eaten my dinner I went to sleep.

## Different verbs/adjectives with different prepositions

If two verbs/adjectives etc take two different prepositions, we must mention both the prepositions.

Just using one preposition with the last verb/adjective will be incorrect.

My wife is aware and involved ***in*** that case. (incorrect) <br>
My wife is aware ***of*** and involved ***in*** that case. (correct; of, in - prepositions)

She is senior and older ***than*** I. (incorrect) <br>
She is senior ***to*** and older ***than*** I. (correct; to, than - prepositions)

But if the two verbs/adjectives etc take the same preposition, then we can use only one preposition. No need to use the same preposition twice. 

He is older and taller ***than*** her younger brother. (correct; than - preposition)
