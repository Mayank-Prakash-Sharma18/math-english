## What are Prepositional Phrases?

A prepositional phrase is a group of words which consists of:
* a preposition,
* prepositional object, and 
* any other words that modify the prepositional object. 

So structure-wise, a phrase that has a preposition as the main particle, is called a Prepositional Phrase. 

In a sentence, a prepositional phrase can function either as:
* an adverbial phrase, or
* an adjectival phrase.
