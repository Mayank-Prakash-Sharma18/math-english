## Prepositions indicating Agency, instrumentality

These are some of the most important prepositions of agency, instrumentality: 

at; by; through; with


### By

#### Concept 1

‘by’ is used in passive voice 

Pattern: Noun + $V_3$ + by + Passive Subject

A letter was written ***by*** me. (passive voice; me – passive subject)

#### Concept 2

by + $V_{ing}$ - means by the medium of

***By*** painting an awesome picture he proved that he was pretty creative. 


### Prepositions with forms of transport 

We use prepositions with modes of transportation when they come with 'go'/'come'/'travel'/'arrive' etc.

#### Concept 1

To talk about means of transport, we use ‘by’.

Pattern: by + noun (means of transport)

E.g. by bicycle, by car/taxi/bus/train, by boat/ ship/plane, by air/sea.

We do not use ‘the’ or ‘a/an’ before the noun in such cases.

We travelled ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">by a/the</span>*** train. (incorrect) <br>
We travelled ***<span class="mak-text-color">by</span>*** train. (correct)

{{% alert note %}}
We say on foot (not by foot).

She goes to the school ***on*** foot. (i.e. she walks to the school.).
{{% /alert %}}

#### Concept 2

We do not use ‘by’ when the reference is to a specific bicycle, car, train, etc. Rather: <br>
We use ‘on’ to mean a specific bicycle, bike, bus, train, ship or plane, and <br>
We use ‘in’ to mean a specific car, taxi, van, lorry or ambulance.

Pattern: on + determiner + Bus / Train / Ship / Plane / Bicycle / Scooter / Bike /...... <br>
Pattern: in + determiner + Car / Taxi /........ 

Jennifer went to the hills ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">by</span>*** my bike. (incorrect) <br>
Jennifer went to the hills ***<span class="mak-text-color">on</span>*** my bike. (correct)

I will go ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">by</span>*** the 9.30 bus. (incorrect) <br>
I will go ***<span class="mak-text-color">on</span>*** the 9.30 bus. (correct)

We travelled ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">by</span>*** Mr. Sharma's car. (incorrect) <br>
We travelled ***<span class="mak-text-color">in</span>*** Mr. Sharma's car. (correct)

We came ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">by</span>*** a taxi. (incorrect) <br>
We came ***<span class="mak-text-color">in</span>*** a taxi. (correct)

#### Concept 3

We use ‘by’ in certain common phrases: <br>
I turned the heater off ***by mistake***.

Other phrases like this include: <br>
by accident; by phone; by bus/car, etc.; by air/road/rail/land/sea; by cheque/credit card; by degrees/stages; by heart; by force; by hand; by post/fax/e-mail (or E-mail).

<!-- #### Concept 4

We use a preposition other than ‘by’, in the following cases: <br>

* if there is a determiner before the noun (e.g. a, an, the, this, that, my, her) <br><br>
I talked to her ***on the phone***. <br>	
He came ***in his new car***. <br>
This was shared with us ***in an email*** from HR.

* if the noun is plural. <br><br>
We never travel ***in buses***. -->

### With

#### With as a preposition

It means with the help of something.

With (as a preposition) is always followed by an object. 

Pattern: with + object

He will go ***with*** me. (me - object) <br>
We should shoot ***with*** a camera and not ***with*** a gun. 

#### With as a coordinating conjunction

When we use 'with' as a conjunction, it comes in the middle of two nouns. Here first noun/pronoun will act as a subject and verb will agree with this first noun/pronoun.

Pattern: Noun/Pronoun + with + Noun/Pronoun (in objective case)

She ***with*** her friends is going to see a movie. 

This structure will be followed only if it's logical. That is, we generally use noun + verb + with + noun. But if the use of 'with' after verb makes the sense ambiguous, we should keep 'with + object' before the verb.  

Many books were bought ***with*** leather bindings. (incorrect - mild error, as it’s a little ambiguous) <br>
Many books ***with*** leather binding were bought. (correct)

He ate chips ***with*** his friends. (incorrect - mild error, as it’s a little ambiguous) <br>
He ***with*** his friends ate chips. (correct)

<!-- #### 'With' in Phrasal expressions

These are phrasal expressions:

I was ***satisfied with*** his performance.

### By Vs. With

We use both ‘by’ and ‘with’ to talk about how something is done, but there are some minor differences.  

* ‘with’ (followed by a noun) is often used to denote an instrument, i.e. to talk about what we use to do something. 

* ‘by’ (followed by a noun or gerund) is often used to denote the agent or the action, i.e. to talk about who did it or what action we took to do something. 

He was stabbed ***by*** a lunatic ***with*** a dagger. (lunatic – agent; dagger - instrument) 

He avoided the accident ***by*** braking hard ***with*** his foot. (braking – action; foot - instrument)

## Preposition of Exceptions or Additions

### Except

#### Except as a preposition

Except / Except for – they mean ‘with the exception of’ or ‘excluding something’

To introduce the thing(s) or person(s) that the main part of the sentence does not include → We use ‘except or except for’

I do not attend any class, ***except for*** the Economy class of Hawking sir. (correct)

Except that + Subject + Verb

### but Vs. except (for)

We can use ‘but’ with a similar meaning to ‘except (for)’, particularly after negative words such as no, nobody, and nothing.

Soon after regaining consciousness, I could remember nothing ***but / except (for) / apart from*** my name.

### But for 

But – it means except <br>
But for – it means without. It is a phrasal form.

***But for*** hard work, we can’t succeed.

### but for Vs. except for

The meanings of ‘but for’ and  ‘except for’ are different. 

We use ‘but for’ to introduce a negative idea. Using it we say what might have happened if other things had not happened. So, use: 

* ‘but for’ to introduce a negative idea and 
* ‘except for’ to introduce an exception.

For example, Sans your cooperation – that is, without your cooperation.

‘besides’ – it means 'as well as' or 'in addition to’ (and not 'with the exception of’)

Compare the following two sentences:

***<span class="mak-text-color">Besides</span>*** a beautiful wife, he also has an awesome job. (correct)

### Apart from 

We can use ‘apart from’ instead of except (for) and besides. So, ‘apart from’ can have multiple meanings. It may mean:

* with the exception of <br>
I don't enjoy reading any novel ***apart from*** Dan Brown’s. (i.e. except for)

* in addition to / as well as <br>
