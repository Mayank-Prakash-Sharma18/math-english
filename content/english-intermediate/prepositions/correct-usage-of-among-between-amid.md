Students often confuse certain prepositions and make silly mistakes in exams. In this article, we will study about some of the most often confused prepositions, such as among, between, amid. 

We will study their use cases, and also some of their variants, such as amongst and amidst. 

## Among vs. Between 

When we see two or more people or things as individual or separate → We use between 

When we see the people or things as part of a group or mass → We use among 

But we don’t use ‘among’ in case of only two people or things.

India is situated ***between*** Russia to the north, China to the east, Pakistan to the west, and Sri Lanka to the south.

Now, let us go into more details. 

### Concept 1

Between (rather than among) is used in reference to more than two in the following cases:

* when we talk about a definite number of things/people etc., i.e. we specify the individual members of the group using singular nouns 
* when we talk about comparisons/mutual relationship/co-operation etc. (e.g. a difference between..., contrast between..., a connection between..., a friendship between..., a link between...)

In this rugby tournament, matches will be played ***between*** South Africa, England and New Zealand. (definite number of countries)  

Treaty of Amsterdam was a treaty ***between*** the nine European nations. (mutual relationship)

We also use ‘between’ to mean ‘meanwhile’

In between → meanwhile

{{% /alert %}}

### Concept 2

We use plural noun/pronoun with ‘between'.

between the countries, between friends, between them/us

### Concept 3: Between .... and

* ‘between' is often followed by 'and' <br>
Pattern: between + and <br><br>
The press conference will be held ***between*** 1 p.m. ***and*** 2 p.m. <br>
My village is somewhere ***between*** Meerut ***and*** Hapur.

* ‘between .... and' takes objective case of pronoun. <br>
There is no relationship ***between him and me***. (not he and I)

### Concept 4

Among is used in relation to more than 2 things which are physically present and easily countable. 

This brunette woman was ***among*** the 88 victims of the green river serial killer. 

So, we can’t use ‘among’ in the following cases:

* We can't use among when the things are uncountable. E.g. destroyed building parts.

* If the things are physically not present, we can't use among. That is, we can't use among with concepts, e.g. problems. 

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- ### Concept 5

We use among (rather than between), in the following cases:

* When we mean 'occurring in' <br>
The COVID pandemic has now broken out ***among*** the European countries. (i.e. 'occurring in')

* When we mean 'one/some of’ <br>
We are ***among*** the best cricket players in the world. (i.e. we are 'some of’ the best cricket players in the world)

* When we mean 'out of’ <br>
***Among*** the metropolitan cities of India, Delhi is the most polluted. (i.e. 'out of’ all the metro cities)

* In the expression 'among other things' (we do not say 'between other things') <br>
***Among other things***, I enjoy reading and travelling. -->


## Among Vs Amongst 

Amongst and Among mean the same. But there are a few minor differences.  

* Amongst comes before ‘the' <br>
There was no co-ordination ***amongst the*** players.

* Among is used before consonant sound, while amongst is used before vowel sound. <br>
among them. ('them' starts with a consonant sound) <br>
amongst us. ('us' starts with a vowel sound)

In modern English, we do not follow this rule. We use 'amongst' wherever it fits well with the rhythm of the sentence.

## Amid vs. Amidst

Amid/Amidst is used for more than two.  Same is true for Among/Amongst. 

Just like Among & Amongst, the meanings of Amid & Amidst are also quite similar, i.e. Amid and Amidst mean the same thing.  

Then what is the difference between them?

Well, the differences are very minor and so we will have to dive deep. 

Amid is used before consonant sound, while Amidst is used before vowel sound. 

Voting was conducted ***amid pandemonium***. (‘pandemonium' starts with a consonant sound) <br>
You should speak for us while you are sitting ***amidst us***. ('us' starts with a vowel sound)

### 'Amid/Amidst Vs. Among/Amongst 

#### Concept 1

‘Amid’ (rather than Among) is used in the collection of three or more, when things are not physically present. (i.e. we can use it with concepts)

#### Concept 2

‘Amid’ (rather than Among) is also used when the things are physically present, but it's difficult to count them. So, 'Amid/Amidst' can be used before uncountable nouns too.

Amid/Amidst – gives the sense of surround, i.e. being surrounded by something. <br>
Among/Amongst – gives the feeling of being a part of something.
