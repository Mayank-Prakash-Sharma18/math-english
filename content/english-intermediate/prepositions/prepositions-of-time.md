at; in; on; after; before; behind; by; during; for; from; into; under; pending; since; through; throughout; till; to; towards; until; with; within.

## at, in and on

### At

We use ‘at’ in the following cases:

* with exact points of time <br><br>
For example: at midnight, at sunrise, at sunset, at day break, at noon, at night, at dusk, at dawn, at midday, at 9 o'clock (i.e. clock time), at 9.45 etc.

* with other short periods that we think of as points <br><br>
For example: at the end of March, at the beginning of the year, etc. <br>
You will get your salary ***at*** the end of the month.

* with short holiday periods <br><br>
I will see you ***at*** Diwali. <br>		 
We often go shopping ***at*** the weekend.

* with mealtimes <br><br>
For example: at breakfast, at lunch, at dinner, etc. <br>
Yesterday ***at*** breakfast, he told me he was leaving the company.

### In

We use ‘in’ in the following cases:

* with longer periods of time. <br><br>
For example: morning, evening, afternoon, seasons (e.g. the spring), days, weeks, months, years, decades (e.g. the 1980's or the 1980s), centuries (e.g. the 16th century), and other periods such as the week before Christmas, the hours before the test, etc. <br><br>
***In*** the summer you can only play in the evening. <br>
***In*** the days that followed his accident, we were in constant turmoil.

* when we talk about how long it will be before something happens. <br><br>
Pattern: in + noun denoting a period of time (expression of time) <br><br>
***In*** a few minutes we will be arriving at Palam Airport, (In more formal situations, we can also use ‘within‘ instead of ‘in’)

{{% alert note %}}
‘in’ means exactly at or before the allotted time (while, ‘within’ means before the allotted time)

E.g. I will do it ***in*** 5 minutes. (i.e. before or at the end of 5 minutes) <br>
I will do it ***within*** 5 minutes. (i.e. before the end of 5 minutes)
{{% /alert %}}

* when we say how long something takes: <br><br>
He learnt how to make an app ***in*** just a matter of months. (i.e. in a few months)

* We use ‘in’ with ‘the middle of...’ <br><br>
I guess he will be joining us some time in the middle of August.

### On

To talk about a particular day, date, part of a particular day, or some special day (e.g. birthday) → We use ‘on’ 

We are leaving ***on*** Monday. <br>
I have got a meeting ***on*** Monday morning. <br>
Aanya’s birthday is ***on*** the 22nd. <br>
I get my salary ***on*** the last day of the month. <br>
I will present you with a new car ***on*** your birthday.	

### At vs. In Vs. On

As you would have noticed, we use ‘at’ with exact points of time, while we use ‘in’ with longer periods of time (Just as we use ‘at’ with smaller and ‘in’ with bigger places). But there are a few more differences in their use cases. 

Let’s compare the use cases of ‘at’, ‘in’ and ‘on’, when they are used as preposition of time.  

#### Use Case 1

We use ‘at’ to talk about exact points in a day/night, e.g. at noon, at sunrise etc. <br>
We use ‘in’ to talk about longer periods of time in a day, e.g. in morning, in afternoon, in evening etc. 

What are you going to do ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">on/at</span>*** the evening? (incorrect) <br>
What are you going to do ***<span class="mak-text-color">in</span>*** the evening? (correct)

I will meet you under the tree ***at*** 7’o clock ***in*** the evening.

{{% alert note %}}
‘in' is used with 'morning/afternoon/evening'. But when a determiner or day/date is mentioned with ‘morning/evening/afternoon’, we use ‘on’. 

Pattern: on + determiner + morning/evening/afternoon .....

We will have some drinks ***on Sunday afternoon***. <br> 
We had some drinks ***on the evening*** of October, the 22nd.  
{{% /alert %}}

#### Use Case 2

We use ‘at’ with night when we mean 'when it is night' or 'each night‘. <br>
While, we use ‘in’ with parts of the day, such as the morning, the evening, etc.

We should not go out on the streets ***at night***. <br>
Met department has predicted light showers ***in the afternoon***.

{{% alert note %}}
When we talk about a particular night we use ‘in the night’.

{{% /alert %}}

#### Use Case 3

Compare the following phrases:

* at the moment (i.e. now, at present)
* in a moment (i.e. in a short period of time)

He’s in the washroom ***at the moment***. <br>			
He will be with you ***in a moment***.

#### Use Case 4: On time vs. In time

Compare the following:

* on time – it means exactly at the set time / on scheduled time. 
* in time – it means exactly at the set time, or before the set time.

I reached the exam centre ***in*** time. (i.e. before the given time) <br>
The examination started ***on*** time. (i.e. on scheduled time)

### When not to use at, in and on 

#### Use Case 1

We rarely use ‘at, in or on’ before the words ‘all, any, each, every, last, next, one, some, this, or that’ when these are followed by a time expression. 

Compare the following sentences:

We will complete our homework ***<span class="mak-text-color">in the morning</span>***. (correct)	<br>
They haven't done anything ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">in all morning</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
They haven't done anything ***<span class="mak-text-color">all morning</span>***. (correct)

We will meet again ***<span class="mak-text-color">on Monday</span>***. (correct)	<br>
I am going to Mewad ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">on next Tuesday</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
I am going to Mewad ***<span class="mak-text-color">next Tuesday</span>***. (correct)

#### Use Case 2

We don't use any preposition (e.g. at, in or on) before: 

* today/tonight/daily, this morning, this afternoon, tonight
* tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the following day, the next day, tomorrow morning, tomorrow evening 
* yesterday, the day before yesterday, yesterday evening, yesterday afternoon, last night

The weather was beautiful ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">on yesterday</span>***. (incorrect)	<br>
The weather was beautiful ***<span class="mak-text-color">yesterday</span>***. (correct) 

He will play ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">on tomorrow</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
He will play ***<span class="mak-text-color">tomorrow</span>***. (correct) 

We arrived here ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">on last night</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
We arrived here ***<span class="mak-text-color">last night</span>***. (correct) 


## Since

### Concept 1

Since is used before a noun or phrase denoting some point of time. <br>
Since is preceded by a verb in the perfect tenses. 

I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">ate</span>*** nothing ***since*** yesterday. (incorrect) <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color">have eaten</span>*** nothing ***since*** yesterday. (correct)

He ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">is</span>*** in love with Ankita ***since*** childhood. (incorrect) <br>
He ***<span class="mak-text-color">has been</span>*** in love with Ankita ***since*** childhood. (correct)

Let us consider what all counts as ‘Points of Time’: 

* Clock time: E.g. since 9 o’clock

* Calendar time: E.g. since 1990s

* Parts of the day: E.g. dawn, sunrise, day break, morning, noon, afternoon, evening, dusk/twilight, sunset, midnight <br>
What have you done ***since*** dusk.

* Last month / week / year <br>
She has been working hard since last month. <br>
We have not made even a single mistake ***since*** last two years.

* Period of time + ago: E.g. 10 years ago. 

* Stages of life: childhood, adulthood, womanhood

* Naming word as a time expression: departure / arrival / marriage /divorce / birth / death / ancient times.	

### Concept 2

Since – it can also be used to denote 'reason'. <br>
***Since*** I was tired, I didn't play the match.

### Concept 3

'since', 'because' and 'as' are not followed by so/therefore/that's why.

But there are a few exceptions to this. For example, have a look at the following sentence:

***As*** you sow, ***so*** you shall reap. (here 'as' is followed by 'so')

### For Vs. Since 

For - denotes period of time <br>			 
Since - denotes point of time

I have been living here ***for*** three years. <br>
I have been living here ***since*** 2019.


## From

‘from’ is not an adverb. When ‘from’ works as a preposition, it may mean:

* From starting point of time <br><br>
Pattern: from + time + to/till/until + time <br><br>
I will be in the library from 5 a.m. to 6 a.m.

* From starting point of a place <br><br>
Pattern: from + place + to + place <br><br>
I drove all the way from Delhi to Mumbai. 

* From some source <br><br>
I came to know about her birthday from your card. <br>
The leaves are falling from the apple tree. 


## During, Over, and Throughout

### During and In

To talk about something that happens within a particular period of time → We use ‘during’ or ‘in’

That is, we can use either ‘in’ or ‘during’ for an event that happened at any general time within the given period of time (i.e. it’s not a one-off event that occurred at some specific point of time within that time period)

The population of Japan has actually fallen ***in*** the last decade. (correct) <br>
The population of Japan has actually fallen ***during*** the last decade. (correct)

***In*** the time that I was in that company, I only once missed my deadline. (correct) <br>
***During*** the time that I was in that company, I only once missed my deadline. (correct)

#### During Vs. In

##### Concept 1

We prefer to use ‘in’ (rather than ‘during’), to talk about an event which happened at a particular point of time in the given time period (i.e. that event occurred once at some particular time, and not again and again).

Monica lost her husband ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">during</span>*** the war. (incorrect) <br>
Monica lost her husband ***<span class="mak-text-color">in</span>*** the war. (correct)

##### Concept 2

To emphasise that something continues for the whole of a particular period of time → We prefer ‘during’ (rather than ‘in’) 

No-one was allowed to enter the conference room ***during*** the meeting. (i.e. during the whole of the meeting)

We can also use ‘throughout’ to express a similar meaning.

We had enough capital to keep running our business ***during*** the financial depression. (i.e. during the whole of the depression) <br>
We had enough capital to keep running our business ***throughout*** the financial depression.

##### Concept 3

To talk about something that happens within the same time as another event or activity (rather than over a particular period of time) → We use ‘during’ (rather than ‘in’)

### During and Over

To talk about an event or activity that goes on for a length of time within a period of time (either for some of that period or for the whole of it) → We can use ‘over or during’ 

Fiscal situation has been improving ***over/during*** the past few years. 

I was so distracted by my personal problems that I don’t remember what happened ***over/during*** the meeting.

#### During Vs. Over

In contrast, to talk about an event or activity that happens within a period of time only for a little duration → We prefer ‘during’ (rather than ‘over’)

He coughed ***<span class="mak-text-color">during</span>*** the song recording. (correct)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Over</span>*** a dance rehearsal, she strained her ankle. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">During</span>*** a dance rehearsal, she strained her ankle. (correct)

### During Vs. For

To say how long something continues (Period of time) → We use ‘for’ <br>
To say when something takes place (Point of time) → We use ‘during’ 

I have been waiting for you ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">during</span>*** three years. (incorrect) <br>
I have been waiting for you ***<span class="mak-text-color">for</span>*** three years. (correct)

She did not eat anything ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">for</span>*** the journey. (incorrect) <br>

We can also use ‘while’ to showcase a point of time  

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">During</span>*** I was teaching, it started raining. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">While</span>*** I was teaching, it started raining. (correct)

## By and Until

To say that something will happen or be achieved either before a particular time or at that time at the latest → We use ‘by’ 

To say that something will continue up to a particular point of time (from the beginning to the end) → We use ‘till/until’

{{% alert note %}}
‘till’ and ‘until’ are usually interchangeable. We can use till instead of until in informal English.
