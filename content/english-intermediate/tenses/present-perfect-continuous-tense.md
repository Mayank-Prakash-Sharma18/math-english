## Uses of Present Perfect Continuous Tense

### Use Case 1

We use Present Perfect Continuous to talk about a situation or activity that started in the past and has been in progress for a period until now (to showcase how long something has been in progress). 

Sometimes we use some time-period reference along with present perfect continuous (e.g. since and for):

He ***has been living*** in Melbourne for over a decade now. (notice the use of ‘for’) <br>
This company ***has been running*** since 1983. (notice the use of ‘since’)

Without any time-period reference, the present perfect continuous refers to a recent situation or activity and focuses on its present results:

It ***has been raining***. (or It’s ***been raining***) (i.e. it’s still raining) <br>
You look exhausted. Yes, I ***have been working*** in the lab. (i.e. I have just stopped working)

### Use Case 2

We use Present Perfect Continuous for an activity that is still ongoing or has recently stopped (i.e. there is a connection with now).

I ***have been talking*** to the lawyers about this defamation case. (still going on)

***Have*** you ***been jogging***? (recently stopped)

{{% alert note %}}
We don't use the Present Perfect Continuous for situations or actions that finished at a particular point in time before now (i.e. those that did not finish recently).

I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">have been reading</span>*** until midnight last night. (incorrect – wrong usage of present perfect continuous tense) <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color">was reading</span>*** until midnight last night. (correct)

He ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">has been putting</span>*** off the decision for long, but eventually he resigned. (incorrect – wrong usage of present perfect continuous tense) <br>
He ***<span class="mak-text-color">put off</span>*** the decision for long, but eventually he resigned. (correct)

### Use Case 3

We use Present Perfect Continuous for actions repeated over a period of time.

Pakistan violates LOC again and again. It ***has been going*** on there for years.

### Use Case 4

We use Present Perfect Continuous when we ask questions with ***‘How long...?’***

How long ***have*** you ***been waiting*** for me?

## Use of for and since

‘For’ is used for a period of time, while ‘Since’ is used for a point of time. 

<img src="../../../media/tenses/tenses-14.png" alt="tenses" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

Consider an example:

I have been playing ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">since</span>*** an hour. (incorrect) <br>
I have been playing ***<span class="mak-text-color">for</span>*** an hour. (correct)

Here ***period of time*** is given (an hour), so we will use ‘for’ and not ‘since’.
