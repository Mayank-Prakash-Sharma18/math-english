Simple Present Tense is also known as Indefinite Present Tense.

## Uses of Simple Present Tense 

### Use Case 1: routine actions, habits, universal truth

We use Simple Present to talk about things in general, i.e.  routine actions, habits, universal truth (things that are always true). 

We use it to say that something happens all the time or repeatedly, or that something is true in general. It is not important whether the action is happening at the time of speaking.

Doctors look after the sick in hospitals. (look – $V_1$) <br>
Sun rises in the East. (rises – $V_{s/es}$)

{{% alert note %}}
Here are some of the indicators which show that the action is habitual:

Always, Seldom, At times, Never, Hardly, At all times, Often, Scarcely, Seldom if ever, Daily, Rarely, Seldom or never, Generally, Barely, More often than not, Usually, Sometimes, Every day (Every + Time expression)
{{% /alert %}}

But there are some exceptions to this rule.

#### Exception 1

Habitual actions conveying a sense of irritation are expressed in present continuous tense.

She is constantly ***losing*** the keys of the car. <br>
You are always ***making*** this mistake. <br>
He is always ***complaining*** about something or the other. <br>

#### Exception 2

Habitual actions conveying a sense of cause and effect are expressed in present continuous tense. 

Aanya ***goes*** for a morning walk every day because she has to participate in a beauty contest. <br>
Aanya ***is going*** for a morning walk every day because she has to participate in a beauty contest. 

Mragank ***does*** vigorous exercise every day because he wants to lose some weight. <br>
Mragank ***is doing*** vigorous exercise every day because he wants to lose some weight.

### Use Case 2: will go on indefinitely

We use the Simple Present to describe situations that exist now and probably will go on indefinitely as far as we know. 

It ***takes*** me an hour to write one article. (takes – $V_{s/es}$) 

Charlie Parker ***plays*** the saxophone brilliantly. (plays – $V_{s/es}$)

Any action/situation that is permanent cannot be put in continuous tense.

I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">am liking</span>*** it. (incorrect) <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color">like</span>*** it. (correct)

I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">am knowing</span>*** it. (incorrect) <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color">know</span>*** it. (correct)

He ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">is believing</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
He ***<span class="mak-text-color">believes</span>***. (correct)

He ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">is loving</span>*** it. (incorrect) <br>
He ***<span class="mak-text-color">loves</span>*** it. (correct)

He ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">is remembering</span>*** it. (incorrect) <br>
He ***<span class="mak-text-color">remembers</span>*** it. (correct)

Let’s see some more uses of Simple Present Tense.

### Use Case 3: headlines and commentary

We use the Simple Present in newspaper headlines and commentary of sports.

For example:

President ***signs*** the nuclear deal. (newspaper headline)

Klusener ***strikes*** the ball and off it ***goes*** towards the boundary line like a bullet. (commentary)

### Use Case 4: report

The Simple Present is used to report what we have heard, read or seen (sometimes in phrases such as I gather, I hear, I see and I understand):

This magazine article ***explains*** why Republicans are going to win the election again.

I ***understand*** you're worried about your son.

I ***hear*** that the neighbours are very rich.

### Use Case 5: in exclamatory sentences

We also use Simple Present in exclamatory sentences beginning with 'here' and 'there' to express what is actually taking place in the present.

Here ***comes*** the train !  <br>
There he ***goes*** !

Simple Present is used to introduce quotations.

Tej Bahadur ***says***, ‘Sweat now in training, save blood in war’. 

### Use Case 6: Proverbial facts

Proverbial facts are expressed in simple present tense for their continued existence or relevance.

It takes two to make a quarrel. 

Nothing succeeds like success. 

One swallow doesn’t make a summer. 

A stitch in time is saving nine.

### Use Case 7: Performative verbs

Performative verbs: Sometimes we do things after saying something. 

For example: <br>
We promise something after saying 'I promise...’; <br>
We suggest something after saying 'I suggest....’ 

These are the verbs that perform the action they describe (called performative verbs). <br>
Some such verbs are: promise, suggest, advise, insist, agree, refuse, admit, accept, acknowledge, apologise, assume, deny, guarantee, hope, inform, predict, promise, recommend, suppose, warn, etc. 

Here we use the Simple Present.

I ***promise*** I won't be late for the class again. (<s>I am promising</s>) <br>
I ***suggest*** that you get yourself a lawyer. (<s>I am suggesting</s>)

We can use modals with performative verbs to sound more tentative or polite:

I ***would suggest*** that you get yourself a lawyer.


## Simple Present Tense for future

### Concept 1

We also use Simple Present tense to express ***planned action of near future*** (i.e. fixed official timetable/fixed official programme).

President ***leaves*** for France next month. <br>
The college ***opens*** on 22nd October. <br>
There ***is*** a full moon tonight. <br>
The sun ***rises*** at 5.18 tomorrow.

{{% alert note %}}
Instead of Simple Present tense, we can also use will + infinitive in sentences like these with little difference in meaning (although using simple present tense suggests that the arrangement is fixed and definite).

President ***will leave*** for France next month. <br>
The college ***will open*** on 22nd October.
{{% /alert %}}

### Concept 2

In case of personal plans or predictions, we do not use simple present tense. Instead we use:

* will,
* going to, or 
* the present continuous

Although terrorism is a problem only in France at the moment, we think it ***affects*** the rest of Europe soon. (incorrect – use of simple present tense is not appropriate here) <br>
Although terrorism is a problem only in France at the moment, we think it ***will affect*** the rest of Europe soon. (correct - will)

I ***am*** just ***stay*** in to watch a movie tonight. (incorrect – use of simple present tense is not appropriate here) <br>
I ***am*** just ***staying*** in to watch a movie tonight. (correct – present continuous)

As he is very tired, I guess he ***is*** just rest tonight. (incorrect – use of simple present tense is not appropriate here) <br>
As he is very tired, I guess he ***is*** just ***going to*** rest tonight. (correct – going to)

### Concept 3

Simple Present tense is used, instead of the Simple Future tense, in clauses of time and clauses of condition. 

#### In adverbial clauses introduced by time conjunctions

We use simple present tense (instead of will), in adverbial clauses introduced by time conjunctions such as after, before, when, till and until.

I shall wait till you ***complete*** your homework. (till you complete your homework – clause of time) <br>
When you ***see*** Meenakshi, tell her that I am sorry. (When you see Meenakshi – clause of time)

#### In conditional clauses

We use simple present tense in conditional clauses with if, unless, in case, and provided.

If it ***rains***, we shall get wet. (If it rains – conditional clause) <br>
I will bring a pistol in case we ***get*** into trouble. (in case we get into trouble – conditional clause)

### Concept 4

We use the simple present tense in that- and wh-clauses when:
* the main clause refers to the future. 
* the that-/wh-clause refers to the future – in this clause we will use simple present tense and not ‘will’.

{{% alert note %}}
We use the ‘will’ in that- and wh-clauses when: <br>
* the main clause refers to the present. <br>
* the that-/wh-clause refers to the future – in this clause we will use ‘will’ and not simple present tense.

I ensure you that the children enjoy the movie. (incorrect) <br>
I ensure you that the children ***will*** enjoy the movie. (correct)

However, if we are talking about a fixed arrangement in that- and wh-clause, we can use either ‘will’ or the simple present tense. 

It is fortunate that a similar flight ***will leave*** at the same time tomorrow. (correct) <br>
It is fortunate that a similar flight ***leaves*** at the same time tomorrow. (correct)

It is not necessary that ‘do/does’ will always work as helping verbs. They can function as main verbs too.

I ***do*** it regularly. <br>
He ***does*** it regularly.

### Structure of Declarative sentences

#### Affirmative Declarative Sentences

Pattern: Subject + $V_1 / V_{s/es}$ + Object

I/we/you/they/plural subject - We will use $V_1$ <br>
he/she/it/singular subject - We will use $V_{s/es}$

Pattern: Subject + do/does + $V_1$ + ....... <br>
Aanya ***does*** meet me every day.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Negative Declarative Sentences

Pattern: Subject + do not / does not + $V_1$ + Object

Aanya ***does not go*** to college. (Aanya – III person singular, so we will use does) <br>
I ***do not go*** to college. (I – I person, so we will use do)

Pattern 1: Do / Does + Subject + $V_1$ + Object?

In general, in case of simple present tense, we use “do/does” to make a sentence negative or interrogative.

Virat ***does*** not like Rohit. <br>
***Do*** you know?

Exception: In case of “is/am/are” use only these helping verbs (is/am/are) to make the sentence negative or interrogative.

***Is*** Mragank a gambler? (Interrogative sentence)
