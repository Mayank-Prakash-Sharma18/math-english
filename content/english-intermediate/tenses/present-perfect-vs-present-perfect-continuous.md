In this article we will compare the following two tenses:

Present Perfect Continuous (I have been doing) and Present Perfect (I have done)

### Use Case 1

Both the present perfect continuous and the present perfect are used to talk about something that started in the past and which affects the situation that exists now.

But they have many different use cases too. Let’s study them. 

### Use Case 2

Sometimes the difference between them is simply one of emphasis.

To ***focus on an activity or event*** which may or may not be finished – We use the present perfect continuous 

To ***focus on the effect of an activity or event***, or the fact that something has been achieved – We use the present perfect

### Use Case 3

To talk about activities or events that are repeated again and again until now - We can use either the present perfect continuous or the present perfect.

The journalist ***<span class="mak-text-color">has been calling</span>*** for an appointment. (correct) <br>
The journalist ***<span class="mak-text-color">has called</span>*** for an appointment. (correct)

<!-- However, if we mention the number of times the activity or event was repeated - we use the present perfect rather than the present perfect continuous.

He ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">has been playing</span>*** in 24 one day international matches so far. (incorrect) <br>
He ***<span class="mak-text-color">has played</span>*** in 24 one day international matches so far. (correct) -->

### Use Case 4

To talk about more temporary situations - We can use either the present perfect continuous or the present perfect.

Are you comfortable with Quantum Physics? <br>
No. I ***have studied*** it only for a couple of months. (present perfect) <br>
No. I ***have been studying*** it only for a couple of months. (present perfect continuous)

To talk about long-lasting or permanent situations, or when we want to emphasise that we are talking about the whole of a period of time until the present - We use the present perfect (rather than the present perfect continuous)

This is the most beautiful painting that I ***have*** ever ***seen***. <br>
Critics ***have*** always ***admired*** Christopher Nolan’s movies.

### Use Case 5

When we want to emphasise that a situation has changed over a period of time up to now, and may continue to change - We prefer the present perfect continuous (and not present perfect)

Performance of your son ***has been improving*** for some time. <br>
The climate change problem ***has been getting*** worse over the last decade.

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- However, if we talk about a specific change over a period of time which ends now, particularly to focus on the result of this change - We use the present perfect.

The population of Delhi ***has grown*** from 0.1 million in 1950 to 10 million today. <br>
The NIFTY Sensex ***has dropped*** by 2%. (it’s a drop in a period up to now) -->
