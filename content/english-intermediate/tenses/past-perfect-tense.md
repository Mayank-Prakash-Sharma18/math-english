## Uses of Past Perfect Tense

### Use Case 1

We use Past Perfect to talk about a past situation or activity that took place before another past situation or activity, or before a particular time in the past.

That is, when two actions happened in the past, we use past perfect to show which action happened earlier than the other. 

Simple Past is used in one clause and Past Perfect in the other.

Let’s see a couple of examples: 

Anand realized that the retail broker ***had duped*** him.

<img src="../../../media/tenses/tenses-15.png" alt="tenses" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

Anand realized – in simple past tense. <br>
the retail broker had duped him – in past perfect tense. 

I ***had met*** her in Berlin before we married in 2015. 

<img src="../../../media/tenses/tenses-16.png" alt="tenses" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

we married in 2015 – in simple past tense. <br>
I had met her in Berlin – in past perfect tense. 

#### Structures

Pattern 1: Subject + had + $V_3$ + ........ before + Subject + $V_2$

<!-- Mr. Kapoor had left India before I had met Shailey. <br> -->
Mr. Kapoor had left India before I met Shailey. 

Pattern 2: By the time + Subject +  $V_2$ + .....+ Subject + had + $V_3$ +......

By the time Mr. Anand reached home, she had typed all the letters.

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- Pattern 3: Subject + $V_2$ + ..... + after + Subject + had + $V_3$ + ......

She told me his name after he had gone. -->

### Use Case 2

We also use Past Perfect to say what we wanted to do, but didn’t.

Verbs used in this fashion – wanted (to), hoped (to), wished (to), expect (to), mean (to), think (about + -ing).

I ***had wanted to*** visit Stonehenge before I left England, but my wife is not feeling well.

Mragank ***had hoped to*** retire at 50, but his financial conditions didn’t allow him to do so.
