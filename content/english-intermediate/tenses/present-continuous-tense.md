## Uses of Present Continuous Tense

### Use Case 1: ongoing action

We use Present Continuous Tense to talk about an action that is ***going on at the time of speaking***. 

I ***am studying***. 

We often use time expressions such as at the moment, at present, now-a-days, these days, today, currently, just (now) and still, to emphasize that the action or event is happening now.

That is, these expressions of time are used to express temporary activity. That’s why we should use present continuous tense with them.

I ***am studying*** English ***at the moment***. <br>
Are you coming to the party? – I ***am just leaving***.

### Use Case 2: something is done repeatedly

We use Present Continuous Tense along with words like always, constantly, continually, or forever, when we want to emphasise that ***something is done repeatedly***. 

Generally this is done when we want to show that we are unhappy about it (including our own behaviour).

They ***are constantly creating*** trouble for me in the office.

We use the Past Continuous tense in the same way:

They ***were constantly creating*** trouble for me in the office.
{{% /alert %}}

### Use Case 3: temporary action

We use Present Continuous Tense for a ***temporary action which may not be actually happening at the time of speaking*** (i.e. this action or event must have begun but not have ended, even though it might not be going on at the time of speaking).

I ***am reading*** ‘The Fountainhead’. (but I may or may not be reading at this particular moment)

The police ***are talking*** to a number of people about the homicide. (but may or may not be talking at this particular moment)

### Use Case 4: changes, developments, and trends

We use the Present Continuous tense when we talk about changes, developments, and trends (i.e. to express gradual changes or process of change).

I ***am beginning*** to realise how challenging it is to be a scientist. <br>
The growing number of tourists ***is damaging*** this serene destination.

<!-- Sometimes some events and changes are going on even at the time of speaking but we cannot see them. They too are represented by Present Continuous Tense.

The population ***is increasing*** day by day. <br>
Coastal areas ***are getting*** submerged. -->


## Present Continuous Tense for future

### Concept 1

We also use the Present Continuous Tense for an action that has already been arranged/planned to take place in the near future.

I ***am going*** to the match tonight. <br>
My parents ***are arriving*** tomorrow.

In case of personal arrangements, we use the Present Continuous tense and not the Simple Present tense.
{{% /alert %}}

### Concept 2

We don't use the Present Continuous Tense for the future:

* when we make or report predictions about activities or events over which we have no control (we can’t plan/arrange these). <br>
I guess it ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">is raining</span>*** soon. (incorrect) <br>
I guess it ***<span class="mak-text-color">is going to rain</span>*** soon. (correct) <br>
I guess it ***<span class="mak-text-color">will rain</span>*** soon. (correct)

* when we talk about permanent future situations. <br>
This shopping mall ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">is having</span>*** nine floors. (incorrect) <br>
This shopping mall ***<span class="mak-text-color">is going to have</span>*** nine floors. (correct) <br>
This shopping mall ***<span class="mak-text-color">will have</span>*** nine floors. (correct)

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- * with the verb ‘be’. <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">am being</span>*** in Noida next month. (incorrect) <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color">am going to be</span>*** in Noida next month. (correct) -->
