In this article we will compare the following:

Going to Vs. Present Continuous Vs. Will Vs. Future Continuous

## Going to Vs. Will

### Use Case 1

We use both ‘will + infinitive’ and ‘going to + infinitive’ to talk about the future. 

Sometimes the difference between them is very small:

Dad ***will*** meet us in the playground at 7 PM. <br>
Dad ***is going to*** meet us in the playground at 7 PM.

However, it’s not as straight forward as it sounds. There are some finer details involved wherein we prefer one or the other. Let’s understand these cases. 

### Use Case 2

We prefer ‘will’ in formal written English to talk about future events that have been previously arranged in some detail (while in spoken English ‘going to’ is preferred).

The live telecast ***will*** begin at 10.00 AM. <br>
Match ***will*** start from 11 AM onwards.

### Use Case 3

When we make a decision at the moment of speaking - we prefer will.

‘Is there someone at the door?' 'Don’t get up. I ***will*** get it.’ <br>
It’s already past midnight. I think I ***will*** go to bed now.

But it’s not only about preference. Sometimes there’s a difference in meaning between the two. Let’s see some of such cases. 

### Use Case 4

While making a prediction we use 'going to' (rather than will) – when we make a prediction about something in the future:
* based on some evidence (i.e. on the basis of something that we feel, see etc. now) or 
* based on some information (i.e. because we have been told that it will happen).

Her face looks pale. I guess she's ***going to*** faint. (prediction based on some evidence)

There’s a gossip going around that Jim and Pam are ***going to*** get married. (prediction based on some information)

### Use Case 5

While making a prediction we use 'will' (rather than going to) – when we make a prediction based on our opinion or our past experience.

Come home. The children ***will*** enjoy seeing you again.

I imagine the theater ***will*** be full for the play on Tuesday.

### Use Case 6: Conditional sentences

In case of conditional sentences/if-sentences:

In the main clause of an if-sentence, we can use ‘will’ or ‘going to’ with little difference in meaning.

If we keep on wasting our time, we ***will/are going to*** flunk our mid-semester. <br>
You ***will/are going to*** spill the milk (if you are not more careful).

However, to describe a future event that immediately follows another, we use will (or another auxiliary), and not going to. In such sentences 'if’ generally means 'when’.

If you concentrate on the top-right corner of the screen, you ***will*** (or ***can***) see Venus.

Conditional sentences - when we say that something (often something negative) is conditional on something else; it will happen if something else happens first.

## Going to Vs. Present continuous 

### Use Case 1

When talking about ***intentions or decisions*** about the future that were made some time before - we use ‘going to’ or the present continuous:

Penny is ***going to*** move back to Nebraska. (going to - reporting an intention) <br>
Penny ***is moving*** back to Nebraska. (present continuous - reporting an intention) <br>
Who’s hosting the next party? Saurabh is ***going to*** do it. (it has already been planned)

Now let us see the cases wherein we prefer one over the other (i.e. ‘going to’ or present continuous). 

### Use Case 2

When we intend to do something in the future, but no definite arrangement has been made - We prefer going to rather than the present continuous. 

But when we emphasise that a definite arrangement has been made - We prefer the present continuous.

### Use Case 3

We generally avoid writing going to + go. Rather use the present continuous form of go.

I ***am going*** to college next year. (rather than - am going to go to college...)


## Future Continuous Tense Vs. Will

### Use Case 1

To talk about decisions that people have made, willingness to do things, inviting, promising, etc. - We use will (not the Future Continuous)

To refer to some future event or action that has been previously arranged - We use the Future Continuous.

### Use Case 2

To sound polite while asking about people's plans – we use Future Continuous Tense (rather than will or the Present Continuous)

We generally want to sound polite when we want to ask them to do something unexpected or difficult.

It is often possible to use ‘going to be + ing’ rather than the Future Continuous to ask about plans in a particularly polite way.

Are you ***going to be starting*** work on the house today?
