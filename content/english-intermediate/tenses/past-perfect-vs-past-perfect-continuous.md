In this article we will compare the following two tenses:

Past Perfect Vs. Past Perfect Continuous

## Use Case 1

To talk about the continuity or duration of a situation/activity - We use the past perfect continuous 

I ***had been studying*** hard since Deepawali when I fell ill. 

To talk about the completion of a situation or activity or its effects - We use the past perfect.

I ***had studied*** hard after Deepawali, but I became careless after Christmas.  

Sometimes the difference between them is simply one of emphasis.

I ***had been studying*** hard, so I decided to take a break. (emphasises the activity) <br>
I ***had studied*** hard, and the results reflected that. (emphasises the result)

## Use Case 2

To talk about how long something went on up to a particular past time - We prefer the past perfect continuous. 

We ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">had watched</span>*** a movie for about five minutes before we realised that we had already seen it. (incorrect) <br>
We ***<span class="mak-text-color">had been watching</span>***  a movie for about five minutes before we realised that we had already seen it. (correct)

To talk about how many times something happened in a period up to a particular past time - We use the past perfect.

We ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">had been watching</span>*** the movie many times before. (incorrect) <br>
We ***<span class="mak-text-color">had watched</span>*** the movie many times before. (correct)

{{% alert note %}}
Some state verbs are not often used with continuous tenses. So, with such verbs we use the past perfect tense. <br> 
(even when we are talking about how long something went on up to a particular past time)

I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">had</span>*** always ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">been believing</span>*** that I will become a successful entrepreneur one day. (incorrect) <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color">had</span>*** always ***<span class="mak-text-color">believed</span>*** that I will become a successful entrepreneur one day. (correct)

We ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">had been owning</span>*** the house for a year before we realized that it was a disputed property. (incorrect) <br>
