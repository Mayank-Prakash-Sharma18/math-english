Simple Past Tense is also known as Indefinite Past Tense.

## Uses of Simple Past Tense 

### Use Case 1: Completed action

We use Simple Past to indicate an action completed in the past. It shows that an action is completely over. 

I ***wrote*** a letter. 

So, for Historical events in the past – We use Simple past tense 

The Second World War ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">has started</span>*** in 1939. (incorrect) <br>
The Second World War ***<span class="mak-text-color">started</span>*** in 1939. (correct)

India ***<span class="mak-text-color">got</span>*** independence in 1947. (correct)

### Use Case 2: With adverbs of past time

Simple Past is often used with adverbs (or adverb phrases) of past time (to express one time activity). For example, with:
* yesterday, ago,
* last + time expression, 
* period of time + back, 
* the other + day/week, 
* passed years such as 2016, 1920

The ship ***sailed*** yesterday. (yesterday - adverb)	<br>
He ***left*** the job a few days ago. (a few days ago – adverb phrase)

Sometimes this tense is used without an adverb of time. In such cases the time may be either implied or indicated by the context.

She ***did*** her assignment.  (here ‘did’ is the main verb and not helping verb) <br>
She ***did not do*** her assignment.  (here ‘did’ is a helping verb, and ‘do’ is the main verb)

Usually in a sentence, 'do' 'does' and 'did' are not used in positive sentences as a helping verb. But to emphasise the main verb, we use 'do', 'does' and 'did' before the main verb. 

In such sentences main verb should be in ‘$V_1$ form’.

He ***did make*** a mistake. (make – main verb in $V_1$ form)
