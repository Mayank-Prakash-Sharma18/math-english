## Uses of Present Perfect Tense

### Use Case 1: Completed activities

We use Present Perfect to indicate completed activities in the immediate past (i.e. recently finished) 

Here we also use some adverbs like, just, recently etc.

She ***has come*** to Canada ***recently***.

He ***has just finished*** it.

### Use Case 2 

We use Present Perfect to denote an action beginning at some time in the past and continuing up to the present moment.

Here we often use since-phrases and for-phrases (prepositional phrases working as adverb phrases).

I ***have known*** her ***for*** a long time.

She ***has been*** ill ***since*** last week.

### Use Case 3

We use Present Perfect to express past actions whose time is not given and not definite (because the action is important and not the time of action).

India ***has developed*** a lot.   (Here, action of development is important not the time of development)

My uncle ***has been*** to Berlin.    (been - main verb)

***Have*** you ***read*** ‘Fountainhead'?

### Use Case 4: Give new information

We often use Present Perfect to give new information or to announce a recent happening.

Don’t go further. There ***has been*** a landslide.

Detectives ***have arrested*** two suspects involved in recent terrorist attacks.

### Use Case 5

Present Perfect suggests some kind of connection between the past and the present time. It helps us showcase how something that happened in the past affects the situation that exists now (i.e. we get to know the consequences).

I ***have completed*** my homework so that I can watch the match.

We can't go ahead with the proposal, because very few members ***have supported*** it.

I ***have seen*** a snake under the carpet. Come quickly!
