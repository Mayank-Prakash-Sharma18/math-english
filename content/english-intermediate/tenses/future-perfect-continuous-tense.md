## Uses of Future Perfect Continuous Tense  

<!-- ### Use Case 1 -->

It is used for actions which will be in progress over a period of time (i.e. for a long time) that will end in the future (i.e. it expresses completion + continuation of action). 

This tense is not used that commonly. 

By next August, we ***shall have been working*** here for three years.

In sentences with the future perfect continuous, we usually mention both the particular point in the future (on Tuesday…, next month… etc.) and the period of time until this point (…for a month, …for 2 years).

By next week I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">will have been knowing</span>*** Julia for six years. (incorrect; know – state verb) <br>
By next week I ***<span class="mak-text-color">will have known</span>*** Julia for six years. (correct)
