In this article we will compare the following two tenses:

Simple Past Vs. Past Continuous  

## Use Case 1

To talk about two or more past completed events that follow each other - We use the past simple for both. 

Kindly note that the first action may or may not have caused the second.

He ***went*** out when his boss ***called*** him. (action of calling caused him to go out)

He ***jumped*** out of the moving bike and ***latched*** on to the terrorists’ car. (no causal relation between the two actions)

## Use Case 2

If two past actions/events went on over the same period of time – We often use the past continuous for both.

Harry ***was working*** in a law firm when Sally ***was living*** in Bristol.

However, we can even use the past simple to express a similar meaning. So, we can rephrase the above sentence as follows:

Harry ***worked*** in a law firm while Sally ***lived*** in Bristol. or <br>
Harry ***worked*** in a law firm while Sally ***was living*** in Bristol.

## Use Case 3: New action in the middle of a longer action 

If a new action happens in the middle of a longer action – We will use past continuous with simple past. 

Simple past will be used for the new action (i.e. second action) and past continuous will be used for the longer action (i.e. first action).

When I ***saw*** her, she ***was studying*** a novel. (first action – was studying, in past continuous; second action – saw, in simple past)

We can also rephrase the above sentence as follows:

She ***was studying*** a novel when I saw her. 

## Use Case 4: Permanent or long-term situation Vs. Temporary situation

To talk about a permanent or long-term situation that existed in the past - We use the past simple (rather than the past continuous)

When I was in college, I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">was playing</span>*** the flute. (incorrect) <br>
When I was in college, I ***<span class="mak-text-color">played</span>*** the flute. (correct)

However, for temporary situations - We can also use the past continuous. 

I ***was participating*** in a contest held by Microsoft in the summer of 2004. (correct) <br>
I ***participated*** in a contest held by Microsoft in the summer of 2004. (correct)

## Use Case 5: Habits and Repeated actions

### Concept 1

To talk about repeated actions/events in the past - We use the past simple (rather than the past continuous) 

He ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">was visiting</span>*** Germany four times last year. (incorrect) <br>
He ***<span class="mak-text-color">visited</span>*** Germany four times last year. (correct)

I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">was going</span>*** past this monster villa every day. (incorrect) <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color">went</span>*** past this monster villa every day. (correct)

### Concept 2

However, to emphasise that the repeated actions only went on for a limited/temporary period of past time – We can also use the past continuous

When Mr. White was in prison, we ***were visiting*** him thrice a month. (correct) <br>
When Mr. White was in prison, we ***visited*** him thrice a month. (correct)

{{% alert note %}}
As we have already seen, when the repeated actions/events provide a longer background to something else that happened in the past - We use the past continuous 

During the time I ***started*** to get epilepsy attacks, I ***was playing*** cricket a lot. (was playing – past continuous; started – simple past)
{{% /alert %}}

### Concept 3

We also use always, continually, etc. with past continuous tense to showcase persistent habits in the past.

She ***was*** always ***betting***.
