In this article we will compare the following two tenses:

Simple Past (I did) Vs. Present Perfect (I have done) 

## Use Case 1: A period of time up to the present Vs. Finished time in the past   

### Concept 1

When we talk about something that happened in a ***period of time up to the present*** - We use the present perfect <br>
Here we tell how long an existing situation has lasted, even if we don't give a precise length of time.

When we talk about something that happened at a particular, ***finished time in the past*** (i.e. for situations that existed for a period of time in the past, but not now) - We use the past simple

Artificial Intelligence ***has made*** many major advances this century. (present perfect) <br>
Scientists ***made*** some fundamental discoveries in the 18th century. (simple past)

You will be thrilled on seeing the science projects our students ***have made***. (present perfect) <br>
Most of the science projects ***were*** excellent. (simple past)

### Concept 2

To talk about something that has been recently invented, produced, discovered or written - We use the present perfect. 

To talk about something that was invented, produced, discovered or written in the more distant past – We use the past simple. 

Scientists ***have discovered*** a new characteristic of dark matter. (present perfect) <br>
Dark matter ***was*** hypothesized by Fritz Zwicky in 1933. (simple past) 

<!-- ### Concept 3

In some cases the main meaning of the sentences is not affected much either way. That is, whether we think of something happening in a period of time up to the present or at a particular, finished time in the past.

I am sure I ***saw*** (or ***have seen***) this man before. <br>
The launch of the spaceship ***was*** (or ***has been***) a success. -->



## Use Case 2: When Vs. How long

To talk about ‘when’ a present situation began rather than for ‘how long’ it has been going on - We use the past simple. 

I ***have had*** this fever for three days now. (focus on how long – so we used present perfect) <br>
I ***started*** feeling feverish three days ago. (focus on when – so we used simple past)

However, if the action/event is no longer going on, then we can also use the past simple to talk about how long something went on.

I ***stayed*** in this hostel for a year. (i.e. I am no longer staying there; focus on ‘how long’, but the event is over – so we used simple past)

## Use Case 3: Repeated actions or events

To talk about repeated actions or events - We can use either the present perfect or the past simple. 

But there are a couple of fine differences we need to keep in mind:
* If we think that the action/event might happen again – We use the present perfect. Often to emphasise it further, we use phrases such as ‘so far’ and ‘up to now’. 
* If we think that the action/event is finished (i.e. it won't happen again) - We use the past simple

Compare the following sentences: 

Dan Brown ***has written*** 5 novels and I have read all, except for the last one. (present perfect – because he may write another novel.) <br>
Dan Brown ***wrote*** 5 novels before he got disenchanted with writing. (simple past – because action of writing novels is over.)


## Use Case 4: States

To talk about states - We can use either the present perfect or the past simple. 

But there are a couple of fine differences we need to keep in mind:
* To talk about a state that existed in the past and still exists now – We use the present perfect. 
* To talk about a state that no longer exists - We use the past simple

Compare the following sentences: 

I ***have known*** him since he was a toddler. (present perfect – because my state of knowing him still exists now.) <br>
I ***knew*** him when we was a kid. (simple past – because my state of knowing him no longer exists)


## Use Case 5

If past time is given in a sentence, the sentence must be in simple past tense and never in present perfect tense.

I ***have come*** yesterday. (incorrect; present perfect) <br>
I ***came*** yesterday. (correct; simple past)


## Use Case 6: Since

### Concept 1

We use since to talk about a period that started at some point in the past and continues until the present time. This is why we often use since with the present perfect.

***Since*** 2018 I ***have lived*** in a small condo apartment near my office. (have lived – present perfect)

Jake ***has been*** unfit ***since*** the last series. (has been – present perfect)

### Concept 2

In a sentence which includes a since-clause, the usual pattern is for the since-clause to contain a past simple, and the main clause to contain a present perfect.

So, with ‘since’ we follow the following patterns:

Pattern 1: present perfect tense + since + simple past tense

I have not met her ***since*** she joined XLRI. <br>
(have not met – present perfect; joined - simple past).

Pattern 2: perfect form of any modal + since + simple past tense

She may have relocated ***since*** he last met her. <br>
(may have relocated - modal in perfect form; met – simple past)

<!-- ### Concept 3

If 'since' is there at the beginning of a sentence, then we follow the following pattern:

Pattern 3: Since + simple past + present perfect

***Since*** Alka joined Oracle, she has not attended any party of ours. <br>
(joined - simple past; has not attended - present perfect)

However, if the two situations described in the main and since-clause extend until the present, then we can use a present perfect in the since-clause too. That is, we get the following pattern:

Pattern 4: Since + present perfect + present perfect

***Since*** I have lived here, I have not seen any salesmen. <br>
(have lived - present perfect; have not seen - present perfect) -->


## Use Case 7: News reports

In news reports:
* We often introduce events with the present perfect, and 
* We provide the details using the past simple. 

The SpaceX space shuttle ***has returned*** safely to earth. It ***landed*** in Kazakhstan yesterday. <br>
(has returned – present perfect; landed – simple past) 


## Use Case 8: Adverbs used with these tenses

### Concept 1

With some of those time adverbs that connect the past to the present – We use present perfect (rather than the simple past).

For example: just, lately, already, since, so far, still, up to now, yet.

Setu cannot go out to play. He ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">just recovered</span>*** from his illness. (incorrect; simple past) <br>
Setu cannot go out to play. He ***<span class="mak-text-color">has just recovered</span>*** from his illness. (correct; present perfect)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Did</span>*** you ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">see</span>*** our dentist ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">lately</span>***? (incorrect; simple past) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Have</span>*** you ***<span class="mak-text-color">seen</span>*** our dentist ***<span class="mak-text-color">lately</span>***? (correct; present perfect)

### Concept 2

With time adverbs that talk about finished periods of time – We use simple past (rather than the present perfect).

For example: in, at, on, once, ago, last, then, yesterday.

Stephan Hawking ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">has died</span>*** in 2018. (incorrect; present perfect) <br>
Stephan Hawking ***<span class="mak-text-color">died</span>*** in 2018. (correct; simple past)

### Concept 3

Some adverbs of time can be used with both the present perfect and the past simple. 

For example: before, for, and recently.

We ***had*** the van ***for*** ten years. (we no longer have it; simple past) <br>
We ***have had*** this van ***for*** five years. (we still have it; present perfect)

<!-- ### Concept 4

We can use time adverbs that refer to the present (e.g. today, this morning/week/month), with either the present perfect or past simple.

If we see time adverbs of the present as a past, completed period of time - We use simple past (rather than the present perfect).

If we see time adverbs of the present as a period including the present moment (i.e. when these periods are not finished at the time of speaking) - We use present perfect (rather than the simple past).

Compare these sentences:

I ***wrote*** two articles this morning. (wrote - simple past, i.e. the morning is over) <br>
I ***have written*** two articles this morning. (have written – present perfect, i.e. it is still morning)

{{% alert note %}}
We do not use the present perfect with adverbs of past time. Instead, we always use simple past. 

Mr. Abhinav ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">has gone</span>*** to Moscow yesterday. (incorrect) <br>
Mr. Abhinav ***<span class="mak-text-color">went</span>*** to Moscow yesterday. (correct; went – simple past)

<!-- ### Concept 5

To further emphasise that we are talking about the whole of a period of time up until the present, we use ‘ever’ and ‘never’ with present perfect.

It is the biggest building I ***have ever seen***. (have seen – present perfect) <br>
I ***have never had*** any issues with my boss. (have had – present perfect)

{{% alert note %}}
We do use ‘ever’ and ‘never’ with the past simple too, to talk about a completed period in the past.

When I was a kid, I ***never bothered*** too much about expenses. (bothered – simple past)
{{% /alert %}} -->
