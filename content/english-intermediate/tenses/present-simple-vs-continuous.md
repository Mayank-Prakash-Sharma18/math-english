In this article we will compare the following two tenses:

Present Simple (I do) Vs. Present Continuous (I am doing)

## Use Case 1: Habits and Repeated actions 

### Concept 1

For habits or things that happen on a regular basis (routine/habitual action) - We use the Present Simple.

I generally ***go*** to bed at 10.30 PM. <br>
Sun ***sets*** in the west. 

However, when talking about an obstinate habit (which persists in spite of advice or warning), we use the Present Continuous with an adverb like always, continually, constantly. 

My son is fast becoming a problem child. He is ***constantly picking*** fights in his school.  

### Concept 2

Also, for repeated actions or events that are happening at or around the time of speaking (temporary action) - We use the Present Continuous.

I ***am hearing*** a lot of complaints about your behaviour these days. <br>
Why ***are you running*** around?

<!-- ### Concept 3

To describe something that we regularly do at a particular time - We can use the present continuous or the present simple. 

We usually ***play*** badminton at 7 PM. (i.e. we start playing at 7 PM) <br>
We ***are*** usually ***playing*** badminton at 7 PM. (i.e. we are already playing at 7 PM) -->


## Use Case 2: Temporary and Permanent situations

If situation is permanent - We use the Present Simple tense. <br>
If situation is temporary (for sure or probably) - We use Present Continuous tense.

Banks ***offer*** credit cards to make more profits as interest rates are higher in this segment. (this is what usually happens, i.e. situation is permanent) <br>
Banks ***are offering*** more credit cards (these days) to give a boost to their profit margins. (it implies a temporary arrangement)

Stephen Hawking ***teaches*** Physics at the University of Cambridge. (it implies a permanent arrangement) <br>
Stephen Hawking ***is teaching*** Physics at the University of Cambridge. (implies that this is not, or may not be, permanent, i.e. it’s probably a temporary arrangement)


## Use Case 3: Commentary, Instructions and Story telling

In commentaries (e.g. on sports events), while giving instructions, telling a story or joke - We often describe the:
* main events using the Simple Present (or Past) tense and 
* longer, background events using the Present (or Past) continuous.

Commentary: Rabada ***balls*** a bouncer and Ponting ***pulls*** it over mid wicket. He's ***playing*** magnificently in this innings...

Story telling: He ***goes*** (or ***went***) up to this goon and ***looks*** (or ***looked***) straight into his eyes. He's ***carrying*** (or ***was carrying***) a sack with teddy bears in it...

Instructions: You ***hold*** your right toe in your left hand. Right, you ***are holding*** it; now you ***touch*** it with your nose.

In broadcast commentaries on sporting events to describe activities in progress (where there is stress on the succession of happenings rather than on the duration) – We use the Simple Present (instead of the Present Continuous)

He ***pulls*** the bouncer, but Jonty Rhodes ***makes*** a brilliant save, and ***throws*** the ball back to the keeper in a jiffy.

<!-- ## Use Case 4

To talk about changes happening around now - We use the Present Continuous. 

The water level of the oceans ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">rises</span>*** very fast. (incorrect) <br>
The water level of the oceans ***<span class="mak-text-color">is rising</span>*** very fast. (correct)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Does</span>*** your Grammar ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">get</span>*** better? (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Is</span>*** your Grammar ***<span class="mak-text-color">getting</span>*** better? (correct) -->


## Present Simple Vs. Present Continuous with respect to State Verbs

With state verbs (i.e. verbs describing states), we often prefer to use the simple present rather than the present continuous.

I really ***enjoy*** playing chess. (enjoy – simple present tense)

These are some of the common state verbs:
* Verbs of Perception - see, taste, smell, hear, notice, recognize.
* Verbs of Thinking Process - think, know, realise, mean, mind, remember, suppose, assume, consider.
* Verbs Showing Possession - own, have, belong, comprise, possess, contain, consist.
* Verbs expressing Feelings or State of Mind – feel, regret, enjoy, believe, like, dislike, love, adore, want, wish, desire, hate, agree, disagree, trust, imagine, prefer, please, hope.
* Verbs in General - look, seem, appear, affect, resemble, cost, require, become, refuse.

But, there are some exceptions to this rule.

### Exception 1

If we want to emphasise that a situation is temporary (around the present time) - We can use the present continuous even with some state verbs. 

I ***consider*** her pretty lucky. (i.e. it’s my view) <br>
I ***am considering*** resigning from my job. (i.e. I am thinking about it now – temporary situation)

Indians ***love*** watching Sachin Tendulkar bat. (i.e. they love it when Sachin Tendulkar bats) <br>
Those Indians ***are loving*** watching Sachin Tendulkar bat. (Sachin Tendulkar is batting right now – temporary situation)

### Exception 2

Some state verbs describe a temporary state (e.g. ache, feel, hurt, look (= seem)).

In such cases, there is little difference in meaning when we use the present simple and present continuous.

Are you fine? You ***look/are looking*** miserable.

<!-- ### Exception 3

When 'have' has a non-state meaning - we can use the present continuous 

E.g. when ‘have’ means 'eat', 'undergo', 'take' or 'hold’.

My friends ***are having*** a get together.

What ***are*** you ***having*** for dinner?  -->

{{% alert note %}}
Verbs that do not have 'ing' form cannot be used in any Continuous tense or Perfect Continuous tense. So, such verbs are used in Simple/Indefinite or Perfect Tenses.

You ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">are knowing</span>*** me. (incorrect – continuous tense not possible) <br>
You ***<span class="mak-text-color">know</span>*** me. (correct; know – simple present) <br>
You are getting to know me. (correct) <br>

I ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">have been knowing</span>*** her for three years. (incorrect – perfect continuous tense not possible) <br>
I ***<span class="mak-text-color">have known</span>*** her for three years. (correct; have known – perfect tense)
