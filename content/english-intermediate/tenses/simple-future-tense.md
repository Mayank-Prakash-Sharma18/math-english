We can talk about the future in English in several ways. For example, by using: 

* Simple Future Tense
* the going to form
* be to + infinitive
* Simple Present Tense
* Present Continuous Tense

In this article we are going to focus on the first three. 

## Uses of Simple Future Tense 

### Use Case 1: Future as a fact

We use Simple Future Tense to talk about things which we cannot control. It expresses the future as a fact. 

My daughter ***will be*** nine next Saturday. 

We ***will know*** about the election result by midnight. 

### Use Case 2

We also use Simple Future Tense to talk about what we think or believe will happen in the future. 

In such cases, we use this tense with expressions like: <br>
I think, I am sure, I expect, I believe, Probably, etc.

I think he ***will get*** the job.  

I am sure New Zealand ***will win*** the rugby world cup.

We also use this tense when we make a decision to do something instantaneously at the time of speaking. 

What will you like to have for drinks ma’am? - I ***will have*** a tequila sunrise.

{{% /alert %}}

### Structure of Interrogative sentences

## Uses of 'Going to'

### Use Case 1

When we have already decided to do something, then we use the 'going to' form (be going to + $V_1$). 

Will you go? – Yes. I ***am going to leave*** tonight.  

I ***am going to play*** in the tournament.

We use going to form – when the action is already decided upon, i.e. we are prepared. (do not use simple future tense in such cases)

We use Simple Future Tense – when we take an instant decision. E.g. if someone asks you, “What will you have in supper?” and you say – “I will have a cup of coffee.”

### Use Case 2

When something seems likely or certain to happen (based on the present), then also we use the going to form. 

I guess it ***is going to rain***.

### Use Case 3

The going to form can also be used to express an action which is about to happen.

In such cases (i.e. for the immediate future) we can also use - be about to + $V_1$.

## Uses of 'Be to + infinitive'

### Use Case 1: formal arrangements, formal instructions

(be to + infinitive) form is used to talk about formal arrangements, formal instructions, and to give orders. It is commonly used in news reports.

The pills ***are not to be taken*** before meals. 

### Use Case 2

(be to + infinitive) is used only in cases where the things can be controlled by people.

We don't know whether the comet ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">is to hit</span>*** the earth or not. (incorrect) <br>
We don't know whether the comet ***<span class="mak-text-color">is going to hit</span>*** the earth or not. (correct)

I firmly believe that we ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">are to succeed</span>*** eventually. (incorrect) <br>
I firmly believe that we ***<span class="mak-text-color">will succeed</span>*** eventually. (correct)

### Use Case 3

We also use (be to + infinitive) in if-clauses to say that something must take place first before something else can take place. The thing that will happen next is placed in the if-clause.

If we ***are to survive***, then we must neutralize that sniper now. (active form)

The colleges must collaborate with corporates if cutting-edge education ***is to be provided***. (passive form)

Compare:

* Use of (be to + infinitive) in if-clauses: <br>
Dravid needs to improve his technique if he ***is to play*** in the test team. <br>
(if he is to play - consequence clause in (be to + infinitive) form. Condition is that he need to improve, the consequence is that he will play.)

* Use of simple present tense for the future in if-clauses: <br>
Dravid can play in the test team if he ***improves*** his technique. <br>
(if he improves - conditional clause in simple present tense. Condition is that he need to improve, the consequence is that he will play.) <br><br>
If it ***snows***, it will get a little warm. <br>
(If it snows – conditional clause in simple present tense)
