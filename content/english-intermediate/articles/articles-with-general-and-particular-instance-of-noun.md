In this article, we will study the various uses of Indefinite and Definite Articles when a general or a particular instance of a noun is involved.

## Articles with General or Unique/Particular Instance

### Concept 1

We use ‘the’ before names of things unique of their kind (i.e. we know that there is only one of a particular thing). 

For example:

* Astronomical objects (***the*** sun , ***the*** world, ***the*** earth)
* Water body (***the*** ocean, ***the*** Arabian sea, ***the*** Ganga, ***the*** Suez canal, ***the*** English channel)
* Mountain ranges (***the*** Himalayas, ***the*** Alps)
* Also, ***the*** sky, ***the*** North Pole, ***the*** jet age, ***the*** international market, ***the*** travel industry, ***the*** arms trade etc. 

### Concept 2

We use ‘the’ before the names of certain books.

For example: ***the*** Vedas, ***the*** Bible, ***the*** Puranas, ***the*** Ramayana.

### Concept 3

We use ‘the’ before musical instruments.

For example: ***the*** guitar, ***the*** flute etc.

She can play ***the*** flute pretty well.

### Concept 4

Sometimes it depends on the context. That is we either use ‘the’ or ‘a/an’ with certain nouns depending on how they have been referred to in a sentence.

We use ‘the’ when we refer to following things in a general way: <br>
the weather, the climate, the human race, the atmosphere, the sea, the public, the environment, the sky, the ground, the wind, the future, the past

However, if we want to describe a particular instance of these we use ‘a/an’.

## Articles for General Description or Unique Description

When we describe someone or something - We use 'a/an' with a singular noun 

This is ***a*** beautiful lake. <br>
English has become ***an*** international language.

When we say that someone or something is unique - we use 'the' (or sometimes zero article) 

It’s not Sydney but Canberra that is ***the*** capital city of Australia. <br>
English is ***the*** international language of business.

## Articles for Already known entities or when Context is known

### Concept 1

We use 'the' when the listener/reader can identify the thing/person we are talking about. Otherwise we use 'a/an'.

### Concept 2

We use 'the' when it is ***clear from the situation*** which person/thing we mean.

This curry smells awesome. What's in ***the*** curry? (it’s clear which curry we are talking about)

What do you think of ***the*** candidate? (it’s clear which candidate we are talking about)

### Concept 3

We use 'the' when we have ***already mentioned*** that person/thing earlier.

Geetanjali took ***a*** cat to the party, but ***the*** cat jumped on the cake and then ran off.  

I gave ***an*** interview yesterday. Some of the questions asked in ***the*** interview were funny.

<!-- ### Concept 4

When the person/thing we mean ***can be understood from what has been said before*** (even if the person/thing is not clear from the situation or hasn't been mentioned before).

We stayed at an awesome resort. ***The*** room (i.e. the room we stayed in) was comfortable, and ***the*** food (i.e. the food we had there) was awesome. -->
