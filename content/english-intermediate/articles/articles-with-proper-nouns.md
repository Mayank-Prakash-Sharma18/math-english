In this article, we will have a look at the use of articles with various Proper Nouns. 

## Articles with Proper Nouns

We usually use zero article before most proper nouns, i.e. we do not use any article with them.

But there are many exceptions to this rule. 

Let us study the rules and their exceptions one by one. 

### Person or Place

We do not use any article with the names of any person or place.

***Anand*** was an awesome player. <br>
***Harappa*** was an ancient civilization.

But there are a few exceptions to this rule. That is, we do use articles a/an before names of person or place in some cases. Let’s see them one by one. 

#### Exception 1

Pattern: a/an/one/some + Proper Noun 

It gives an indication of two things:

* Someone
* Nothing is known about the person, except the name 

***A*** Mr. Sharma has been selected for the prize. <br>
***Some*** Mr. Sharma has been selected for the prize. (we can use both ‘some’ and ‘a’; both are correct) 
	
Use of a/an or some/one indicates that Mr. Sharma is not known to the speaker and he knows only the name that has been conveyed to him. 

#### Exception 2

Pattern: a/an + Proper Noun

It may also mean - like one / similar to. Here proper noun works as a common noun.

He considers himself to be ***a*** Shakespeare.

We also use this pattern to refer to a painting by a famous artist, e.g., 'a Van Gogh'.

#### Exception 3

Pattern: the + Proper Noun

We use this pattern in the following cases:

##### Case I: 

When the name of a person or place represents a set of qualities (rather than that individual person/place) which is used for comparative purpose, 'the' comes before that proper noun.

He is ***the Hitler*** of Turkey. <br>
Kanpur is ***the Manchester*** of India

Shakespeare is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">a</span>*** Kalidas of England. (incorrect) <br>
Shakespeare is ***<span class="mak-text-color">the</span>*** Kalidas of England. (correct)

##### Case II:  

We use ‘the’ with the name of a person:

* when we want to specify that person in a group or 
* when we want to emphasise that a person is the one that everyone probably knows about.

That's not ***the*** Arnold Cooper I went to college with.

You are talking about ***the*** Neil Armstrong, aren’t you?

Ashoka ***the*** great, was an Indian emperor. (great - adjective)

##### Case IV: 

When we use ‘the’ before the plural of a surname, then it means the whole family (i.e. husband, wife and children)

We use plural verb with it.

Pattern: The + Plural Surname (i.e. Family) + Plural verb

Annie is going to Agra to see the Tajmahal with Singhs. (incorrect) <br>
Annie is going to Agra to see the Tajmahal with ***<span class="mak-text-color">the</span>*** Singhs. (correct; the Singhs means the family of Singhs)

The Sharmas ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">has</span>*** been close to my heart. (incorrect) <br>
