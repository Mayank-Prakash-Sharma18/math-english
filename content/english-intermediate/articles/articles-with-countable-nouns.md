In this article, we will study the various uses of Indefinite and Definite Articles with Countable Nouns.

## Articles with Singular Countable Noun

### Concept 1

In case of singular countable nouns, we use:

* the - to talk about the general features or characteristics of a class of things or people (and not any specific thing or person). 

* a/an - to talk about an unspecific thing or person.

Notice the difference:

***<span class="mak-text-color">The computer</span>*** has revolutionised publishing. (correct - the statement is about computers in general) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">A computer</span>*** has revolutionised publishing. (incorrect - computers in general have done this, not an individual computer)

But notice these two sentences:

***The computer*** is an important research tool. (correct – the general class of computers is an important research tool.) <br>
***A computer*** is an important research tool. (correct – any particular computer is an important research tool.)

That is, this is true of both the general class and an individual item.

#### Exceptions

##### Exception 1

The two nouns man and woman can be used in a general sense (if they mean mankind/womankind) without either article.

***Man*** draws strength from his family. <br>
***Woman*** is a finer and more sensitive version of man.

But we will definitely use an article if man/woman means a specific or unspecific male/female person. 

I saw ***a man*** at the porch. (correct) <br>
He is ***the man*** of the match. (correct)

##### Exception 2

The Indefinite Article is also used in the sense of any. This way we can single out an individual as the representative of a class. 

***A horse*** is a faithful animal. <br>
***A student*** should respect his teacher.

In present day English we even use 'a man' and 'a woman' (or 'men' and 'women') to represent the general class of mankind/womankind.

***A woman*** is more sensitive than ***a man***. (correct) <br>
***Women*** are more sensitive than ***men***. (correct)

Let’s see some more rules when it comes to the use of articles with singular countable nouns. 

### Concept 2

When we define something - we generally use ‘a/an’ rather than ‘the’.

***A thermometer*** is a device used to measure temperature.

### Concept 3

In exclamatory sentence, a/an is used after 'what' and 'how' and before the singular countable noun.

What ***a*** great party! <br>
What ***a*** shot!

### Concept 4

We use ‘a’ with a few words that denote the number of countable nouns.

E.g. a hundred, a million, a dozen, a couple etc.

It’s ***a million*** dollar deal. <br>
I will like to buy ***a dozen*** bottles.

## Articles with Plural Countable Nouns 

We do not use an article before plural countable nouns when they are used in a general sense.

***Children*** like toys.

***Computers*** are used in almost all educational institutions now.

#### Exception

These plural countable nouns do take ‘the’ when used with a particular meaning.

Where are ***the children***? (i.e. our children)

## Other uses of Articles

### Articles in case of Job

To talk about a person's job in general, we use 'a/an'. 

But to talk about a person's job title, or their unique position, we use 'the' or zero article.

He was ***a*** company director when he retired. (talking about his job in general) <br>
She is (***the***) director of the company. (talking about the person’s job title)

After 'the position of', 'the post of', or 'the role of' we use zero article before a job title.

Dr. Sheldon has taken on ***the post of*** Academic Director.

### the + noun + of phrase 

'The' is often used with ‘of-phrases’ in the following patterns:

* the + Noun + of-phrase (connecting two nouns) <br><br>
The corona virus could have killed off half ***the population of the world***. <br>
He was woken up by ***the sound of gunshots***. 

* the + back/beginning/bottom/end/middle/side/top + of-phrase <br>
This pattern is used to refer to a particular place, time, etc. <br><br>
In ***the middle of his lecture*** a student fainted and fell on the ground.

### Articles in case of Ordinals

We use ‘the’ with ordinals (i.e. first, second, third etc.).

She was ***the*** first guest to arrive to the party.

***The*** third season of the sitcom ‘Friends’ was the best.

We do not use any article before cardinal numbers (i.e. one, two, three etc.).

Compare:

Act three of this novel is very interesting. (three – cardinal number) <br>
***The*** third act of this novel is very interesting. (third – ordinal number)

### Replacement of per/one 

We can use a/an:

* instead of ‘one’ <br><br>

I have ***a*** pen. (correct)

* to say one of a type <br><br>
He eats ***a*** meal which is not nutritious. <br>
Birds of ***a*** feather flock together.

* in place of 'per'. <br><br>

He earns fifty thousand ***per*** month. (correct) <br>
He earns fifty thousand ***a*** month. (correct)

### Articles with Fractions

'a' is used before fraction part of mixed fractions.

6 ½ liter - six and ***a*** half liter <br>
5 ¼ meter - five and ***a*** quarter meter

### Articles with verb acting as a noun

We use ‘a/an’ before a verb, when that verb is used as a noun.

Let us have ***a*** talk with them. <br>
I am going for ***a*** walk. <br>
Do you need ***a*** ride?

### Articles with many/rather/quite/such

We use ‘a/an’ before a singular noun if it comes after many/rather/quite/such.

Many ***a*** man died in World War II. <br>
It is rather ***a*** pity that he could not come along with us. <br>
It is quiet ***an*** impossible task. <br>
That was such ***a*** rash thing to do.

### Articles in Phrases

We use ‘a/an’ in some phrases too.

For example: in a fix, in a hurry, in a nutshell, make a noise, make a foot, keep a secret, as a rule, at a stone's throw, a short while ago, at a loss, take a fancy to, take an interest in, take a liking, a pity, tell a lie.

What you just told us was all ***a lie***. <br>
I expect the students of this class to not make ***a noise*** while the principal is taking the rounds.
