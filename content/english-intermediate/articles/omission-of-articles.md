In this article, we will have a look at the various cases where we need not use an article, often referred to as Zero article. 

## Transitive verb + Object 

We do not use any article in certain phrases consisting of a transitive verb followed by its object.

For example:

to catch fire, to take breath, to give battle, to cast anchor, to send word, to bring word, to give ear, to lay siege, to set sail, to lose heart, to set foot, to leave home, to strike root, to take offence.

## Preposition + Prepositional Object 

We do not use any article in certain phrases consisting of a preposition followed by its object.

For example:

at home, in hand, in debt, by day, by night, at daybreak, at sunrise, at noon, at sunset, at night, at anchor, at sight, on demand, at interest, on earth, by land, by water, by river, by train, by steamer, by name, on horseback, on foot, on deck, in jest, at dinner, at ease, under ground, above ground.

## Noun + preposition + noun

If both the nouns in [Noun + preposition + noun] are the same word, then we do not use any article with them.

Village after village was plundered.

If the two nouns are different, then the first noun takes ‘the’. 

***The*** water of this glass.

However, the first noun will take ‘a/an’ or a number if we have to count it.

***A*** friend of mine. 

***Two*** friends of mine. 

## 'what kind of'

We do not use any articles before the nouns, in sentences, starting with:
* 'what kind of, 
* 'what sort of, 
* 'what type of and 
* 'what variety of.

What sort of ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">a</span>*** man he is! (incorrect) <br>
What sort of man he is! (correct)
