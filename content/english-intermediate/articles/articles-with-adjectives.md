## Article + Adjective working as Noun

When we use definite article ‘the’ before an adjective (of quality), it becomes plural common noun and denotes an entire class. We use plural verb with such nouns. 

E.g. the poor, the rich, the honest, the old, the young etc. 

***The*** poor are in constant struggle.

In such cases the real noun is hidden and understood. 

E.g. the poor = the poor people
{{% /alert %}}


## Articles with Superlative Adjective

### Concept 1

We use 'the' before a superlative adjective, if it is followed by a noun or defining phrase (otherwise we often leave out ‘the’, particularly in an informal style).

***The*** darkest cloud has a silver lining. (darkest - superlative adjective; cloud - noun)

This bike is ***the*** most expensive in the collection. (most - superlative adjective)

Why did you decide to join this job? <br>
It was (***the***) best. (informal style) OR <br>
It was ***the*** best job.

### Concept 2

We also use ‘the’ before a noun (with emphasis) to give the force of a superlative.

You are ***the*** man! 

The Verb is ***the*** word in a predicate. (i.e. the main word) 


## Articles with Comparative Adjective

If two comparative degrees are directly or inversely proportional to each other, we use ‘the' before both comparative degrees.

***The*** more gadgets you use, ***the*** higher your electricity bill will be.

***The*** more you study, ***the*** better marks you will get.

When we make a choice, we use:

* comparative degree, if one out of two are chosen. <br>
Pattern:  the + comparative degree + of <br>
He is ***the*** brighter of the two students.

* superlative degree, if one out of many are chosen.  <br>
Pattern:  the + superlative degree + of <br>
He is ***the*** best of all the students.

## Miscellaneous Concepts

### Concept 1: 'same' and 'whole’

We use ‘the' before adjectives 'same' and 'whole’.

She is ***the*** same girl that sent me a friend request.

***The*** whole year has been wasted by you.

<!-- ### Concept 2: 'all' and 'both’

We use ‘the' after adjectives 'all' and 'both’. -->

### Concept 2: Few and Little

Few and Little gain different meanings when used with different articles. 

Few:
* Few – almost zero (but not zero).
* A few – Some.
* The few – All that is available.

Little:
* Little – almost nothing (but not nothing).
* A little – Some.
* The little – All that is available.

### Concept 3: so/as/too/how/quite + adjective

If so, as, too, how and quite are used before adjectives, then we will use ‘a/an’ before the singular noun that follows.

Pattern: so/as/too/how/quite + adjectives + a/an + singular noun 

It is too heavy ***a*** bat for a young player. (heavy – adjective; bat – singular noun)

Infosys is not so big ***a*** company as you think. (big – adjective; company – singular noun)
