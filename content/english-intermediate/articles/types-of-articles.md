There are two Articles – a (or an) and the.

<img src="../../../media/articles/types-of-articles.png" alt="types of articles" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

An article needs a noun in absence of which, we cannot use any article.

## Types of Articles

There are two types of Articles:

* Indefinite Article

* Definite Article

### Indefinite Articles

<img src="../../../media/articles/types-of-articles1.png" alt="types of articles" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

An Indefinite Article leaves <strong>indefinite</strong> the person or thing spoken of, i.e. the noun is not specified. 

***A*** mechanic (i.e. any mechanic).

***An*** elephant (i.e. any elephant).

#### Concept 1: Indefinite article with singular countable nouns

We generally use indefinite article before singular countable nouns (when they are indefinite and introduced for the first time).

This is ring. (incorrect) <br>
This is ***<span class="mak-text-color">a</span>*** ring. (correct)

She gave me apple. (incorrect) <br>
She gave me ***<span class="mak-text-color">an</span>*** apple. (correct)

##### Exception

We do not use an article before a singular countable noun, if there already is a determiner for it.

This is my book. (my – determiner) <br>
I like this book. (this – determiner) <br>
I have two books. (two – determiner) <br>
This book is new. (this – determiner)

#### Concept 2: Indefinite article with plural nouns

'A/An'  should not be used with a plural nouns.

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">A</span>*** boys are playing. (incorrect; boys – plural noun) <br>
Boys are playing. (correct)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">A</span>*** teachers have arrived. (incorrect; teachers – plural noun) <br>
Teachers have arrived. (correct) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">The</span>*** teachers have arrived. (correct)

#### Concept 3: Indefinite article with uncountable nouns

A/An is not used with uncountable nouns. 

She gave me ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">an</span>*** advice. (incorrect) <br>
She gave me advice. (correct)

<!-- But there are a few exceptions to this rule. Let’s have a look at them. 

##### Exception 1

Some uncountable nouns do take an indefinite article before them, e.g. ‘noise’ takes 'a' before it.

Please do not make ***a*** noise. (noise – uncountable noun)

##### Exception 2

A few words are used before certain uncountable nouns to make them countable.

I will just have ***a*** slice of bread. (bread – uncountable noun) <br>
I have ***a*** piece of information for you. (information – uncountable noun) -->


### Definite Article

<img src="../../../media/articles/types-of-articles2.png" alt="types of articles" style="width:27%;height:27%;">

Definite article is normally used for some specific person or thing (i.e. a definite noun), i.e. something that we can point out, visualize or that has already been introduced.

She saw ***the*** mechanic. (i.e. some ***particular*** mechanic) 

Once upon a time, there lived ***a king***. ***The king*** was very cruel. <br>
(notice that in the second instance of ‘king’ we used ‘the’, as it had already been introduced.) 

The definite article is used before:

* singular countable nouns, e.g. the car 
* plural countable nouns, e.g. the cars
* uncountable nouns, e.g. the milk

<br><hr><br>

## A versus An

The choice between 'a' and 'an' is determined by sound. 

### Use of An

We use ‘an’ before these words:

* A word beginning with a vowel sound. <br>
E.g. ***an*** orange, ***an*** umbrella, ***an*** enemy, ***an*** ink-pad.

* A word beginning with a silent letter ‘h’ and a vowel sound (i.e. initial consonant 'h' is not pronounced).
E.g. ***an*** hour, ***an*** honour.

### Use of A

We use ‘a’ before these words:

* A word beginning with a consonant sound. <br>
E.g. ***a*** boy, ***a*** horse.

* A word starting with a vowel letter but still beginning with a consonant sound. <br><br>
E.g. ***a*** university, ***a*** union, ***a*** utensil, ***a*** European, ***a*** ewe, ***a*** unicorn, ***a*** useful article. <br>
(these words begin with a consonant sound of ‘yu’) <br><br>
***a*** one-rupee note, ***a*** one-eyed man. <br>
(‘one’ begins with the consonant sound of ‘w’)

<!-- ### Use with Abbreviations

We use An before Abbreviations said as individual letters (that begin with A, E, F, H, I, L, M, N, O, R, S or X): <br>
E.g. ***an*** MP, ***an*** FBI agent, ***an*** IOU 

We use A before Abbreviations said as words: <br>
E.g. ***a*** NATO general, ***a*** FIFA official  -->

## Position of Articles

### Pattern 1

An 'article' comes before a 'noun’.

Pattern: Article + Noun

He is ***a*** student. (student - noun) <br>
That is ***an*** island. (island - noun)

### Pattern 2

If an adjective qualifies the noun, the 'article' comes before the 'adjective’.

Pattern: Article + Adjective + Noun

He is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">a</span>*** poor. (incorrect; poor – adjective; noun missing) <br>
He is poor. (correct; poor – adjective working as subject complement) <br>
He is ***<span class="mak-text-color">a</span>*** poor boy. (correct; poor – adjective; boy - noun)

She is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">an</span>*** honest. (incorrect; honest - adjective; noun missing) <br>
She is honest. (correct; honest – adjective working as subject complement) <br>
She is ***<span class="mak-text-color">an</span>*** honest girl. (correct; honest – adjective; girl - noun)

#### Exception

If there is a singular countable noun between as...as, so...as or so...that, and it needs an article, then that article will come just before the noun. 

Pattern 1: as + Adjective + Article + Noun + as <br>
He is as great ***a*** man as Mragank.

Pattern 2: so + Adjective + Article + Noun + as <br>
She is not so clever ***a*** woman as Aanya. 

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- Pattern 3: so + Adjective + Article + Noun + that <br>
He is so weak ***a*** boy that he cannot work. -->

### Pattern 3

If an 'adverb' qualifies the 'adjective' qualifying the 'noun', the 'article' comes before the 'adverb’.

Pattern: Article + Adverb + Adjective + Noun

He is ***a*** very good student. (very – adverb; good – adjective; student - noun)

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- #### Exception

In exclamatory sentences we use articles differently. 

Pattern 1: Adverb + Article + Adjective + Noun <br>
What ***a*** beautiful shot!  

Pattern 2: Adverb + Adjective + Article + Noun <br>
How beautiful ***the*** necklace is!   -->
