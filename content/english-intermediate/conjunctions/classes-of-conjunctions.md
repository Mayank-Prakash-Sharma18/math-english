There are two classes of Conjunctions:

* Co-ordinating Conjunctions

* Subordinating Conjunctions

## What are Co-ordinating Conjunctions?

Co-ordinating Conjunctions - they join together clauses of equal rank, i.e. coordinating clauses. 

Co-ordinating clauses have their own independent meaning and can stand on their own.

Birds fly ***and*** fish swim. 

The chief Co-ordinating Conjunctions are: 

and, or, but, for, while, nor, also, either-or, neither-nor, yet, then, as well as, with, together with, without, besides, alongwith, not only...but also, not merely...but also, whether...or, else, or else, still, so, therefore, otherwise, nonetheless, however, nevertheless, hence, thus,  whereas etc. 

### Clauses of equal rank status

* Subject - Subject 
* Object – Object
* Compliment – Compliment 
* Preposition – Preposition
* Verb – Verb
* Adjective – Adjective
* Adverb – Adverb

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Either</span>*** Meenakshi will dance ***or*** sing with me. (incorrect) <br>
Meenakshi will ***<span class="mak-text-color">either</span>*** dance ***or*** sing with me. (correct)

Our company ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">not only</span>*** manufactures keyboards ***but also*** headphones. (incorrect) <br>
Our company manufactures ***<span class="mak-text-color">not only</span>*** keyboards ***but also*** headphones. (correct)

### Replacement of Co-ordinating Conjunctions

Most of the Co-ordinating Conjunctions may be replaced with a comma, semicolon, or colon (except ‘or’, ‘nor’).
 
Aanya went out to play ***but*** Geetanjali stayed in to work. <br>
Aanya went out to play; Geetanjali stayed in to work.

### Types of Co-ordinating Conjunctions 

Co-ordinating Conjunctions are of four kinds: 

#### Cumulative or Copulative Conjunctions 

They just add one statement to another or one word to another (two nouns, two pronouns, two adjectives etc).

She is rich ***and*** happy. (and connecting two adjectives – rich, happy) 

#### Adversative Conjunctions 

They express opposition or contrast between two statements.

This is a slow, ***but*** certain method. <br>
I was humiliated, ***still*** I did not react. 

#### Disjunctive or Alternative Conjunctions 

They express a choice between two alternatives.
 
She must admit her crime, ***or*** she will get a harsher punishment. <br>
Work quickly, ***else*** you will not be able to deliver the project on time. 
 
#### Illative Conjunctions 

They join two actions in which one action is the result of the other action (i.e. they express an inference).

All precautions must have been neglected in Italy, ***for*** the covid-19 spread rapidly. 


## What are Subordinating Conjunctions?

Subordinating Conjunction – it joins sub-ordinating clause with main clause. 

The main Subordinating Conjunctions are: 

after, because, if, that, in order that, so that, unless, until, till, since, ever since, before, after, as long as, as soon as, that, so long as, because, as, as if, even if, even though, though, although, hardly...when, if, whether, scarcely...when, no sooner...than, lest, provided that, supposing, in case, when, whenever, where, who, whoever, however, while.

***As soon as*** the speech started, the demonstrators rushed to the platform. <br>
(As soon as the speech started – subordinate clause; the demonstrators rushed to the platform – main clause)

‘than’ – it is also a Subordinating Conjunction.

I like you better ***than*** she (likes you). <br>
I like you better ***than*** (I like) her. 
{{% /alert %}}

### Types of Subordinating Conjunctions 

Subordinating Conjunctions may be classified according to their meaning: 

#### Time

when, whenever, till, until, before, since, while, as soon as, as long as, just as, after

The patient died ***before*** I could do anything. <br>
Many things have happened ***since*** we met last year. 

#### Place

where, wherever

We can play ***wherever*** we want.

#### Cause or Reason: since, because, as 

***Since*** you have asked for it, it will be provided to you.  <br>
My apprehensions are becoming a reality, ***because*** my son is performing poorly in academics. <br>
***As*** my manager was not there, I spoke to his assistant. 

{{% alert note %}}
If 'as’ and ‘since’ denote a reason, they are not followed by 'so’

***As*** he was ill, ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">so</span>*** he could not play. (incorrect) <br>
***As*** he was ill, he could not play. (correct)

***Since*** she is a liar, ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">so</span>*** we cannot trust him. (incorrect) <br>
***Since*** she is a liar, we cannot trust him. (correct)

We work ***so that*** we may grow. <br>

#### Result or Consequence

#### Condition

{{% alert note %}}

She is ***not as*** good a student ***as*** you. (Negative sentence) <br>
She is ***not so*** good a student ***as*** you. (Negative sentence)

## Words that can work both as subordinating and coordinating conjunction

Few words can function both as subordinating and coordinating conjunction, depending on what meaning they convey. 

Let’s see some of such words.

### However

However is a:

* coordinating conjunction – when it means ‘even though/but’ <br>
Mayank is very hard-working, ***however*** there seems to be some fault in his stars. (as ‘however’ is a coordinating conjunction here, so we cannot put it in the beginning) 

* subordinating conjunction - when it means ‘no matter how much’ <br>
***However*** difficult my life is, I will make it a grand success. 

### While

While is a: 

* coordinating conjunction – when it means ‘whereas’ <br>
Your dog is cute ***while*** mine is ugly. (as ‘while’ is a coordinating conjunction here, so we cannot put it in the beginning) 

* subordinating conjunction - when it means ‘during’ <br>
***While*** I was studying, he was playing in the backyard. 

<br><hr><br>

## Position of subordinating conjunctions

We can put a subordinating conjunction anywhere.

* $Clause_1$ + Subordinating conjunction + $Clause_2$ = meaningful
* Subordinating conjunction + $Clause_2$ + $Clause_1$ = meaningful

My manager thinks I am satisfied ***because*** I don’t complain. (correct)

***Because*** I don’t complain, my manager thinks I am satisfied.  (correct) <br>
(Because I don’t complain - sub-ordinate clause; because – subordinating conjunction) 


## Position of coordinating conjunctions

If we put a coordinating conjunction at the beginning then it will be meaningless. Though we can place a coordinating conjunction anywhere in the middle. 

* $Clause_1$ + Coordinating conjunction + $Clause_2$ = meaningful
* Coordinating conjunction + $Clause_2$ + $Clause_1$ = meaningless
