## What is a Conjunction?

Conjunction - a word, or a group of words which connects two or more than two:

* Letters – E.g. Let X ***and*** Y be two runners.  (and – conjunction; X, Y - letters)

* Words - E.g. Trump ***and*** Putin are strong world leaders. (and – conjunction; Trump, Putin – words) 

* Phrases - E.g. Indian democracy ***and*** American democracy are the largest and the oldest respectively. (and – conjunction; Indian democracy, American democracy – phrases)

* Clauses - E.g. He said ***that*** he would study. (that – conjunction; He said, he would study - clauses)

* Sentences –  Conjunctions join together sentences and often make them more compact. <br>
E.g. He is my brother. He will play in my team. <br>
He is my brother, ***so*** he will play in my team.


## Conjunctions Vs. Relative pronouns, Relative Adverbs and Prepositions

Conjunctions merely join. They do no other work. 

Take this chair ***and*** give it to him. (and - conjunction) 

But Relative Pronouns, Relative Adverbs and Prepositions not only join but also do more. E.g. a preposition governs a noun or pronoun.

Let’s see some examples:

This is the book ***that*** Any Rand wrote. (that - relative pronoun; it not only joins two parts of a sentence, but also refers to the noun ‘book’) 

This is the venue ***where*** we will get married. (where - relative adverb; it not only joins two parts of a sentence, but also modifies the verb ‘will get married’) 

She sat ***beside*** Mragank. (beside – preposition; Mragank – a noun which is the object of the preposition ‘beside’, which governs it)
