In this article, we will study about the various types of Conjunctions. 

## Correlative Conjunctions

Correlative Conjunctions or Correlatives - Conjunctions which are used in pairs. 

For example:

### either - or 

***Either*** this ***or*** that. 

### neither - nor 

It is ***neither*** useful ***nor*** decorative. 

### both - and 

We ***both*** fear ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">as well as</span>*** adore him. (incorrect) <br>
We ***both*** fear ***<span class="mak-text-color">and</span>*** adore him. (correct)

### whether - or 

It does not matter anymore ***whether*** you submit your assignment now ***or*** not. 

### not only - but also (OR not merely - but also)

***Not only*** is he rude, ***but also*** halfwit. <br>
***Not merely*** is he rude, ***but also*** halfwit. 

### though - yet (rare in current English) 

Though he has lost everything, ***yet*** he has not lost his fighting spirit. (correct) <br>
Though he has lost everything, he has not lost his fighting spirit. (correct – we can drop ‘yet’)

We do not use ‘still’, ‘but’ and ‘else’ with ‘though’.

Though he has lost everything, ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">still</span>*** he has not lost his fighting spirit. (incorrect) <br>
Though he has lost everything, ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">but</span>*** he has not lost his fighting spirit. (incorrect) <br>
Though he has lost everything, ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">else</span>*** he has not lost his fighting spirit. (incorrect)

{{% alert note %}}
When we use Conjunctions as Correlatives, we place each of the correlated words immediately before the words to be connected. 
 
She ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">not only cleared</span>*** GMAT, ***but also*** SSC. (incorrect) <br>
She ***<span class="mak-text-color">cleared not only</span>*** GMAT, ***but also*** SSC. (correct)

## Compound Conjunctions

Compound Conjunctions – When we use compound expressions as Conjunctions. 

Let us see some of these compound conjunctions: 
 
### even if 

Now they won’t be able to chase down the target ***even if*** they hit boundary on each ball. 

### as if 

They are celebrating ***as if*** they have won the trophy. 

### in order that 

The teacher repeated the concept ***in order that*** all students might understand. 

### on condition that 

I will give you the password ***on condition that*** you won’t sneak around. 

### so that 

We save in our young days ***so that*** we may live in peace in old age. 

### provided that 

You will succeed ***provided that*** you work hard and smart. 

### as though 

He walks ***as though*** he owns the world. 

### as well as 

Sachin ***as well as*** Jayasurya was playing for Mumbai. 

### as soon as 

He went on holidays ***as soon as*** he qualified GRE.

## Misplaced Co-relative conjunctions

Many times conjunctions are used at wrong places in a sentence. Especially, when conjunctions are in pairs (co-relative), the position of the conjunction matters. 

Let us see some of the commonly misplaced co-relative conjunctions. 

### either...or and neither...nor 

We use either...or and neither...nor just before the choice words.

I will ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">either</span>*** have milk ***or*** coffee. (incorrect) <br>
I will have ***<span class="mak-text-color">either</span>*** milk ***or*** coffee. (correct)

Sit ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">either</span>*** quietly ***or*** go away. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Either</span>*** sit quietly ***or*** go away. (correct)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Neither</span>*** he is playing ***nor*** writing. (incorrect) <br>
He is ***<span class="mak-text-color">neither</span>*** playing ***nor*** writing. (correct)

### not only … but also

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Not only</span>*** he flunked his written exam ***but also*** his practical assessment.  (incorrect) <br>
He flunked ***<span class="mak-text-color">not only</span>*** his written exam ***but also*** his practical assessment. (correct)

In the sentences given above, 'his written exam' and 'his practical assessment' are the two nouns we are talking about. ‘not only' should be placed just before 'his written exam' and 'but also' should come just before 'his practical assessment'.
