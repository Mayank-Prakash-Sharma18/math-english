## Masculine Gender 
A noun that denotes a male person/animal. <br>
Examples: boy, lion, hero 

## Feminine Gender 
A noun that denotes a female person/animal.<br>
Examples: girl,	lioness, heroine

## Common Gender 
A noun that denotes either a male or a female.<br>
E.g. friend, servant, enemy, cousin, person, student, infant.

When such nouns are used in singular, we use these pronouns for them - his/he/him<br>
Every ***student*** should complete ***his*** homework.<br>
A ***person*** should behave with others the same way ***he*** wants others to behave with ***him***.

## Neuter Gender 
A noun that denotes a thing that is neither male nor female (i.e., thing without life).<br>
E.g. chair, cycle, house, tree.

Objects without life are often <strong>personified</strong>. We speak of them as if they were living beings and regard them as males or females.

Masculine Gender – used for objects known for strength and violence.<br>
E.g. Sun, Time, Death, Summer, Winter <br>
The ***sun*** provides ***his*** light to everyone without discrimination.

Feminine Gender – used for objects known for beauty, gentleness, and gracefulness.<br>
E.g. Moon, Earth, Spring, Autumn, Nature, Peace, Hope, Charity.<br>
***Spring*** has brought with ***her*** a spectacle of greenery.

## Why recognizing noun gender is necessary?

Noun gender differentiation is necessary for using appropriate pronouns in their place.
 
For example:
dog -  we can use it or he.  (we will use he when the gender has to be emphasized)<br>
cow -  we can use it or she. (we will use she when the gender has to be emphasized)<br>
body -  we can use he, she or it.  (we will use he/she when the gender has to be emphasized)

country - we can use it or she. (we will use she when country is personified)<br>
(same goes for moon, nature, ship etc)<br>
sun - we can use it or he. (we will use he when sun is personified)

## Ways of forming the feminine of nouns

### Using an entirely different word

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Masculine</th>
    <th>Feminine</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Boy</td>
    <td>Girl</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Brother</td>
    <td>Sister</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>King</td>
    <td>Queen</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Adding a syllable 

##### Adding -ess

-ess is the commonest suffix used to form feminine nouns. We now use only this suffix to form new feminine nouns. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Masculine</th>
    <th>Feminine</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Author</td>
    <td>Authoress</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Giant</td>
    <td>Giantess</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mayor</td>
    <td>Mayoress</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Sometimes -ess is added after dropping the vowel of the masculine ending:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Masculine</th>
    <th>Feminine</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Actor</td>
    <td>Actress</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Prince</td>
    <td>Princess</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In some cases the masculine noun can be changed a lot and then 'ess' is put at the end.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Masculine</th>
    <th>Feminine</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Emperor</td>
    <td>Empress</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Duke</td>
    <td>Duchess</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>God</td>
    <td>Goddess</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Master</td>
    <td>Mistress</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### Adding -ine, -a, -trix, etc

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Masculine</th>
    <th>Feminine</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hero</td>
    <td>Heroine</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sultan</td>
    <td>Sultana</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Testator</td>
    <td>Testatrix</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Placing a word before or after

In some cases first or second word of compound masculine noun are changed. 

In the following compound nouns, the second word has been changed:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Masculine</th>
    <th>Feminine</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Grandfather</td>
    <td>Grandmother</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Landlord</td>
    <td>Landlady</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Peacock</td>
    <td>Peahen</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In the following compound nouns, the first word has been changed:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Masculine</th>
    <th>Feminine</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Man-servant</td>
    <td>Maid - servant</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Brother-in law</td>
    <td>Sister-in-law</td>
  </tr>
</table>
