There are two ways in which nouns can be classified. 

* Traditional Classification
* Modern Classification 

## Traditional Classification

### Proper Noun

Proper Noun - the name of some <strong>particular</strong> person, place, thing or animal.

Examples: - The Red fort, Delhi, Duster, Tigger

***Shiva*** is my friend. <br>
I live in ***Greater Noida***.

* Proper Nouns are always written with a capital letter at the beginning.
* We use zero article before a proper noun.

### Common Noun

Common Noun - a name given in <strong>common</strong> to every person, thing, place or animal of the same class, category or kind.

Examples: - Boy, girl, dog, country, capital, etc.

Asoka was a great ***king***. (Ashoka – proper noun; king – common noun)<br>
Kangna is a very intelligent ***girl***. (Kangna – proper noun; girl – common noun)

* Unlike proper noun, common nouns are always written with a lowercase letter at the beginning.
* Unlike proper noun, we ***compulsorily*** use some article before a common noun.

Proper Nouns can sometimes be used as Common Nouns:<br>
Tesla was the ***Lukman*** of his age.<br>
Kalidas is often called the ***Shakespeare*** of India, but rather it should be the other way round.

### Collective Noun 

Collective Noun - the name of a collection of <strong>similar</strong> persons, things or animals taken together and spoken of as one whole.<br>
E.g. Crowd, mob, team, flock, herd, army, fleet, jury, family, nation, parliament, committee.

The ***jury*** found Ted Bundy guilty of serial killings.<br>
The cops dispersed the ***crowd***.<br>
The German ***army*** was defeated in France.

In case you forget them, then you can use words like a group of, a bunch of. <br>
E.g. A bunch of bananas. <br>
You can say a group of criminals instead of a gang of criminals. <br>

##### Verbs and Pronouns to be used with collective nouns

Usually collective noun is used as singular (when it shows one collection). <br>
Here, verb – singular; pronoun – singular (E.g. it, its, itself)

Examples:<br>
The ***crowd*** was surging. It was swelling too. (was – singular verb; It – singular pronoun)<br>
The ***board*** has decided to elect its chairman. (has - singular verb; its - singular pronoun)<br>
The ***jury*** is unanimous in its decision. (is - singular verb; its - singular pronoun)<br>

{{% alert warning %}}
Note:  we never use he / she / him / her etc for collective names.<br>
The ***government*** is doing her work. (incorrect)<br>
The ***government*** is doing its work. (correct)
{{% /alert %}}

Collective nouns can be used as plural too (When talking about more than one collections or  one collection with a case of division or  when talking about the individual members of a collection). <br>
Here, Verb – plural; Pronoun – plural (they,  them,  their,  themselves etc.)

They can be used as plural if:
* when we talk about two or more collections<br>
The ***crowds at two places*** were surging. They were swelling too. (were – plural verb; they – plural pronoun)

* there is a division among the members of the collective noun <br>
The ***jury*** were divided in their opinions. (were – plural verb; their – plural pronoun)
 
* the individual members are being talked about.<br>
The ***team*** have to get their uniforms altered. (have - plural verb; their – plural pronoun)

{{% alert note %}}
Note that some collective nouns are always used as plural, as they are always seen as individual members forming that group, e.g. Police.<br>
***Police*** have registered the case. (have – plural verb)

<!-- ##### Types of Collective Nouns

Collective nouns are of two types:

* Compact – self sufficient in meaning, e.g. army, class, family. <br>
They can be made plural, e.g. by suffixing s/es etc to them. 

* Non-Compact – not self sufficient in meaning, e.g. team, pack, pride. <br>
We add ‘of + adjunct’ to them, in order to make them meaningful. Also, we make the adjunct plural to make their plural:<br>
E.g. pride of lions, pack of cards.  -->

### Abstract Noun 

An Abstract Noun is usually the name of a feeling, quality, action, or state considered apart from the object to which it belongs. It has no physical existence. E.g. :<br>
* Feelings – love, sadness, happiness. 		<br>
* Action - laughter, theft, movement, judgment, hatred.<br>
* Quality - goodness, kindness, whiteness, darkness, hardness, brightness, honesty, wisdom, bravery.<br>
* State - childhood, boyhood, youth, slavery, sleep, sickness, death, poverty.

The names of the Arts and Science (e.g. grammar, music, chemistry, etc.) are also Abstract Nouns.

##### Formation of Abstract Nouns

Abstract Nouns are formed:

* From Adjectives:<br>
Kindness (from kind); honesty (from honest).<br>
[Most abstract nouns are formed this way.]

* From Verbs:<br>
Obedience (from obey); growth (from grow).

* From Common Nouns:<br>
Childhood (from child); slavery (from slave).

##### Can Abstract Nouns be Plural?

Abstract noun is uncountable in general (with some exceptions).  So, generally we use it in singular.
E.g.  time, beauty, death, music etc.

Some exceptions:<br>
demand, demands; life, lives; death, deaths; time, times

***life***: <br>
It is uncountable when it implies the phenomena of life (so we cannot say lives).<br>
***lives*** are beautiful. (incorrect)<br>
***life*** is beautiful. (correct)<br>

However, it is countable when it implies a person.<br>
Every ***life*** is precious. (correct)<br>
All ***lives*** are precious. (correct)<br>
 
***death***:<br>
It is uncountable when it implies the phenomenon of death (so we cannot say deaths).<br>

However, it is countable when it implies a person.<br>
Many ***deaths*** have occurred in China due to coronavirus. (correct)

### Material Noun

It is the name of a substance/matter. <br>
E.g. Cotton, Gold, Milk

<!-- ##### Can we use articles before Material Nouns?

We can’t use a number or a/an before a material noun.<br>
This bracelet is made of ***a gold***. (incorrect)<br>
This bracelet is made of ***gold***. (correct)

However,  if there is a counting word (number, a/an)  before a material noun or it has been used in plural,  then there may be any one of the following cases:

* material noun has been used as an adjective<br>
one gold ring, a gold ring,  an iron rod

* material noun is not a material noun but gives some other meaning<br>
E.g.  India won two ***silvers***. (silver medals)<br>
He was in ***irons***. (chained) -->

##### Can Material Nouns be Plural?

Material noun is  singular. We can’t use s/es to make it plural.<br>
E.g.  Silver ***is*** white.

However,  if there are more than one material which have not been mixed, then we can use plural:<br>
E.g. Iron and gold ***have*** been kept separately.

If they are mixed then we have to use singular:<br>
The required mixture of iron and silver ***has*** been made.

## Modern Classification

### Countable nouns 

Definition:<br>
Countable nouns (or countables) - the names of objects, people, etc. that we can count.<br>
E.g. book, dog, apple, girl, engineer.

OR

A noun which can be made plural is called countable Noun.

Only Common nouns (and Compact Collective nouns) can be countable nouns. 

### Uncountable nouns

Definition:<br>
Uncountable nouns (or uncountables) - the names of things which we cannot count (mainly substances and abstract things).<br>
E.g., milk, oil, air, sugar, salt, gold, love, honesty. 

OR

A noun which can’t be made plural is called uncountable noun.

Only Material or Abstract nouns (and also Non-compact Collective nouns) can become uncountable nouns. 

##### Countable nouns have Plural forms

Countable nouns have plural forms while uncountable nouns do not. <br>
For example:<br>
Books (correct)<br>
Milks (incorrect)

So, with uncountable nouns we always use singular verb and singular pronoun. 

##### Use of Articles with Countable nouns

We can use a/an before countable nouns. <br>
We've got a ***dog***. (dog – countable noun)

Uncountable nouns are not used with a/an. <br>
It’s healthy to breathe some fresh ***air*** in the morning. (air – uncountable noun)
