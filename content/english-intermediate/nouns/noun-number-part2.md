In this article we will study the Nouns that do not change form. 

## Singular and the Plural alike

Certain nouns are used in both singular and plural form. <br>
E.g. swine, sheep, deer; cod, trout, salmon; aircraft, spacecraft, series, species. 

If they are used in singular sense, they take singular verb and if they are used in plural sense, they take plural verb.

A sheep ***is*** grazing in the field. <br>
Two sheep ***are*** grazing in the field.


## Nouns used only in the singular

These are of two types:
* Nouns that look Singular and are Singular
* Nouns that look Plural but are in fact Singular

They take singular verb.

Examples of such nouns:

* Names of subjects - E.g.	mathematics, physics, electronics, etc.<br>
Mathematics ***is*** his favourite study.

* Title of a book or a chapter - E.g. David Copperfield, Great Expectations, Da Vinci Code

* Name of an organisation - E.g. the UN

* Name of a country or a place - E.g. the  USA, South Africa

* Name of an uncountable noun

* Names of some common diseases -	E.g. measles, mumps, rickets <br>
Measles ***is*** infectious.

* Names of some games - E.g.	billiards, draughts <br>
Billiards ***is*** my favourite game.

* The word news <br>
No news ***is*** good news.


## Nouns used only in the plural

These are also of two types:
* Nouns that look Plural and are Plural
* Nouns that look Singular but are in fact Plural

They take plural verb with them.

### Look Plural and are Plural

Examples of such nouns:

* Names of instruments which have two parts forming a kind of pair - E.g. scissors, tongs, pincers, spectacles, goggles, sunglasses.

* Names of certain articles of dress - E.g. trousers, drawers, breeches, jeans, tights, shorts, pyjamas, pants. <br>
Where ***are*** my pants?

* Certain other nouns - E.g. annals, thanks, proceeds (of a sale), tidings, nuptials, assets. <br>
All his assets ***were*** seized.<br>
The proceeds ***were*** deposited in the bank.

### Look Singular but are Plural

Certain Collective Nouns, though singular in form, are always used as plurals (because here their individual members are being talked about). <br><br>
These are:<br>
4 P’s – people, police, poultry, peasantry <br>
3 C’s – cattle, cavalry, clergy <br>
Gfvsy – gentry, folk, vermin, staff, youth 	<br>
 
As they are plural, we don’t use a/an with them. Also, don’t make them plural, as their meaning is already plural.

Examples:

These poultry ***are*** his. <br>
Where ***are*** these cattle going? <br>

<hr>

## Special case of Pair Nouns

Pair noun is a noun with two complementary parts.<br>
E.g.  shoes, trousers, spectacles

Kinds of pair nouns: <br>
* Pair nouns with joint complementary parts 
* Pair nouns with separate complementary parts

### Joint complementary parts 

Pair noun with joint complementary parts -  they will always be used in a joint form<br>
E.g. trousers, spectacles, leggings, pyjamas, cargoes, tights, scales, goggles, eyeglasses, binoculars, jeans, pants,  pliers, tongs, scissors

* We cannot change the spelling of this noun.  
* They are considered plural word.  Hence we will use plural verbs with them (e.g. ‘are’ instead of ‘is’).

E.g. This binocular is useless. (incorrect – cannot change spelling; need to use plural verb with them)<br>
These binoculars are useless. (correct)

### Separate complementary parts

Pair noun with separate complementary parts:<br>
E.g.  shoes, sandals, boots, slippers, gloves, stockings, mitten

* It is possible to change the spelling of this kind of pair noun.<br>
shoes -  plural noun<br>
a shoe -  singular noun <br><br>
For example:<br>
I have bought new shoes. (correct)<br>
You are missing a shoe. (correct – we can change the spelling of such pair nouns with separate complementary parts)

* We can use singular or plural verb with them, depending on how they have been used.<br><br>
For example:<br>
My shoes are dirty. (correct – we can use plural verb with them, as here shoes is plural)<br>
My left shoe is dirty. (correct – we can use singular verb with them, as here shoe is singular)

#### Counting plural nouns

In order to count pair nouns we use ‘a pair of’ and 'pairs of' just before such nouns.

I have a scissors. (incorrect – to count we need to use ‘a pair of’ or ‘pairs of’)<br>
I have a pair of scissors. (correct)<br>
I have three pairs of scissors. (correct)

I have bought two shoes. (incorrect – to count we need to use ‘a pair of’ or ‘pairs of’)<br>
I have bought two pairs of shoes. (correct)

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- #### ‘A pair of’ Vs. ‘pairs of’:

A Pair of + nouns having two parts + Singular Verb<br>
Pairs of + nouns having two parts + Plural Verb<br>

E.g. a pair of trousers OR a pair of shoes – singular noun<br>
two pairs of trousers OR two pairs of shoes – plural noun 

Examples: <br>
A Pair of shoes ***have*** cost me two hundred dollars. (incorrect)<br>
A Pair of shoes ***has*** cost me two hundred dollars. (correct)

Many pairs of trousers ***is*** lying here and there. (incorrect)<br>
Many pairs of trousers ***are*** lying here and there. (correct) -->
