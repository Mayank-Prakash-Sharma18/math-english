In this article we will study some miscellaneous concepts related to Nouns.

## Noun + Preposition + Noun

If a noun is repeated and there is a preposition between these two instances, then both the instances of such a noun should be in singular form.

For example:

Alexander kept on plundering ***town after town***.

To make this marketing campaign a success we need to send our salesmen ***door to door***.
