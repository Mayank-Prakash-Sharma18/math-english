## Definition

Noun - a word used as the name of a person, place or thing.

Persons, places and things are visible. However, we also give names to things that are not visible:

* FAQS – Feelings, Actions, Quality, State (these are felt only)

* UNIT – Amount, Weight, Distance, Height, Speed, Period of time

## Identification of Nouns

We can identify a noun using various methods: 

* By definition
* By asking questions – what, who and whom
* By formation
* By using noun finders 

### By definition

Noun is a naming word. If any word is telling some identity then that word will be a Noun.

### By asking questions 

We can identify a noun by asking any of these questions:
* What?
* Who?
* Whom?

Note: If you have studied the 'Structure of Sentence' module, the you probably will recall that we use these questions to identify subjects and objects in a sentence too.

Examples: <br>
The ***captain*** decided the ***team***. (Who? – captain; What? – team)<br>
***Saurabh*** punched ***Anand***. (Who? – Saurabh; Whom? – Anand)<br>
***Aanya*** asked ***Meenakshi*** for ***help***. (Who? – Aanya; Whom? – Meenakshi; What? – help)<br>

Consider the following two sentences:<br>
***Djokovic*** went home. (Who? – Djokovic; Where? – home, so home here is an adverb and not a noun) <br>
***Andrew*** loves his ***home***. (Who? – Andrew; What? – home, so home here is a noun) <br>

### By formation

We can find a noun using suffix, prefix and root words. 

If these are there at the end of a word then generally that word is a noun:
ment, ness, ence, sion, ism, ist, ity, tion, dom, er/or, ship, hood.

E.g. evidence, friendship, childhood

### By using noun finders 

Noun finders: - my/your/his/her..... 

To find out whether a word is a noun or not use:<br>
Noun finder + word (noun) -  It will make a meaningful phrase if the word is a noun (in most cases). 

Examples:<br>
Death – my death, your death, etc. (meaningful phrase, so death is a noun)<br>
Beauty – my beauty , your beauty  (meaningful phrase, so beauty is a noun) <br>
Beautiful – My beautiful, your beautiful (not a meaningful phrase, so beautiful is not a noun) <br>

But there are exceptions:<br>
Kilometre – my  kilometre, your kilometre  (no sense, but kilometre is a noun)
