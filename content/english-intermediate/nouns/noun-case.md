There are four principal cases of nouns:

1. Subjective (or Nominative) Case -  noun is used as a subject

2. Objective Case - (Accusative and Dative cases) <br>
Accusative case -  noun is used as direct object <br>
Dative case -  noun is used as indirect object <br><br>
Note: In English accusative and dative cases are one and the same. So we just call them as objective case.

3. Possessive (or Genitive) Case -  noun is used to show possession

4. Vocative Case - noun is used to address somebody

These can function as subject/object in a sentence:
* Noun
* Pronoun
* Noun equivalent – Gerund, Infinitive, Noun Clause/Phrase

## Subjective/Nominative Case

A noun or pronoun is in the Nominative Case or Subjective Case: 

* when it is the subject of a sentence (or you can say Subject of a verb) <br><br>
For example: <br>
He is going to be a big star one day. <br>
(He – pronoun, working as subject, is in subjective case)

* when it completes a being verb, i.e. acts as a subjective complement (called Predicate Noun). <br><br>
For example: <br>
He is my brother. <br>
(my brother – subjective complement in subjective case)

To find the Nominative, put ***Who?*** or ***What?*** before the verb. 

***Saurabh*** threw a stone. (Who threw a stone? - Saurabh)

***The clock*** fell on Tom. (What fell on Tom? - clock) 

## Objective Case 

A noun or pronoun is in the Objective Case : 

* when it receives the action of a transitive verb (i.e. is the Direct Object of a verb). <br>
Samuel kicked ***him***.  (him – direct object in objective case)

* when it serves as the object of a preposition.  <br>
I am sure that you will be helped by ***him***. (him – prepositional object in objective case)

* when it is used as an indirect object. <br>
Nicole gave ***me*** a laptop. (me – indirect object in objective case)

* when it is used as an objective complement.  <br>
They made him the ***vice-president***. (vice-president - objective complement in objective case)

Note: You may find that in some books, direct objects and objects of preposition are said to be in accusative case and indirect objects and objective complement are said to be in dative case. But in English, there is no difference as such between accusative case and dative case. So, we can use a common term for both of them, i.e. objective case.

To find the Accusative put, ***Whom?*** or ***What?*** after the verb and its subject. 

James threw ***a stone***. (James threw what? – stone, which is a direct object)

The clock fell on ***Tom***. (The clock fell on whom? – Tom, which is the object of preposition ‘on’) 

## Distinguishing between Subjective and Objective cases

### In case of Nouns

Nouns in English have the <strong>same form</strong> in the Subjective and the Accusative case. 	

Mragank broke the ***window***. (window - object) <br>
The ***window*** was broken. (window - subject) 

They are distinguished by the order of words, or by the sense - The Subjective generally comes <strong>before</strong> the verb, and the Accusative <strong>after</strong> the verb. 

### In case of Pronouns

In case of pronouns, spellings of pronouns in subjective and objective cases may be different.

## When to use Nominative and Objective cases?

#### Concept 1

In a sentence whenever we need a subject, we should use the subjective case. And whenever we need an object, we should use the objective case.

Let’s see some examples:

I found ***he*** jumping. (incorrect – he is an object, but it is in subjective case here)<br>
I found ***him*** jumping. (correct)

***Her*** writes well.  (incorrect – her is a subject, but it is in objective case here) <br>
***She*** writes well. (correct)

#### Concept 2

In case of subjective complement, we will always use the subjective case.
 
It is ***us***. (incorrect)
It is ***we***. (correct – ‘we’ is the subjective complement and ‘is’ is a linking verb here)

It is ***me***. (incorrect)
It is ***I***. (correct - ‘I’ is the subjective complement and ‘is’ is a linking verb here)

#### Concept 3

Preposition is followed by an object (noun/pronoun in objective case). <br>
E.g. against him, about her, between you and me, because of him

I went their because of ***she***. (incorrect) <br>
I went their because of ***her***. (correct)

Note:  However when ‘because’ is used as a conjunction,  we can use subjective case after because, i.e. because + subject + verb.

Summary:

In a sentence whenever we need a subject or subject complement, we should use the subjective case.

Whenever we need an object (direct, indirect, prepositional) or object complement, we should use the objective case.

## Vocative Case 

A noun used to call somebody is in vocative case. 

We can use 'you' for a noun of vocative case. 

For example:

***Children*** come here. (children – in vocative case) <br>
***You*** come here.

***Aanya*** go there. (Aanya – in vocative case) <br>
***You*** go there.

## Possessive Case

When the form of a noun is changed to show ownership or possession, it is said to be in the Possessive (or Genitive) Case.

The Possessive answers the question, ‘Whose?’ 

This is ***Amit’s*** bike. (Whose bike? - Amit’s)

The possessive case does not always denote possession. It is also used to denote authorship, origin, kind, etc. 
	
Mr. Sharma's house (the house where Mr. Sharma lives – shows possession) <br>
Dan Brown’s novel (the novel written by Dan Brown – shows authorship)  <br>
The Minister's speech (the speech delivered by the Minister – shows origin) <br>
A children’s park (a park for children – shows kind) <br>
A week's holiday (a holiday which lasts a week – shows kind) <br>
Aanya's school (the school where Aanya goes – shows connection) <br>
