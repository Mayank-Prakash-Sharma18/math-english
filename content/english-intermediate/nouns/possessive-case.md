In this article we will study how to make possessives of nouns and pronouns.

##  Forming possessive case of nouns

### When noun is singular

When the noun is singular, the possessive case is formed by adding 's to the noun. <br>
E.g. the ***girls’s*** laptop; the ***king's*** crown. 

To make the possessive form of names ending in -s, we can add either apostrophe (') or 's. <br>
E.g. It’s Sam ***Jones'*** (or Sam ***Jones’s***) villa.

The letter s is omitted in a few words where <strong>too many hissing sounds</strong> would come together. <br>
E.g. for ***conscience'*** sake; for ***goodness'*** sake; for ***justice'*** sake; for ***Jesus'*** sake; ***Moses'*** laws.

### When noun is plural

When the noun is <strong>plural but does not end in s</strong> (e.g. irregular plurals), the possessive case is formed by adding ‘s’. <br>
E.g. ***men's*** club; ***children’s*** toys. 

When the noun is <strong>plural, and ends in ‘s’</strong>, the possessive case is formed by adding only an apostrophe (‘) (i.e. we omit ‘s’) <br>
E.g. ***boys’*** high school; ***dogs’*** bones.

### When noun contains several words

When a noun consists of several words, the possessive sign is <strong>attached only to the last word</strong>. <br>
E.g. The President of ***Russia's*** visit. 

In case of compound nouns, apostrophe can come only at the end. <br>
E.g. Commander-in-***chief's*** orders; daughter-in-***law’s*** brother.

Note: However, while making plural of compound nouns we modify the main word, e.g. ***Commanders***-in-chief.
{{% /alert %}}

When two nouns are in apposition, the possessive sign is <strong>put to the latter only</strong> (i.e. at the end of brief description). <br>
E.g. That is Stephan Hawking ***the scientist's*** house. <br>
Someone has stolen my brother, ***Anand’s*** watch. <br>
Do you support Mr. Modi, ***the prime minister of India’s*** decision. (the prime minister of India’s - Noun-in-Apposition) <br>

### When nouns are connected by ‘and’

When two nouns are closely connected (they share one thing together. i.e. common possession), the possessive is <strong>put to the latter</strong>. <br>
E.g. Ajay and ***Mragank’s*** institute. 

But each of two or more connected nouns must take the possessive sign if <strong>separate possession</strong> is implied. <br>
E.g. ***Dan Brown's*** and ***Michael Crichton's*** novels.

##  Forming possessive case of pronouns

### anybody, anyone etc.

***‘s*** (i.e. apostrophe s) is used with anybody/nobody/everybody/somebody/anyone/someone/no one/everyone.<br>
E.g.: Everyone's concern is no one's concern.<br>
Everybody's business is nobody's business.<br>

If 'else' is used with anybody/nobody/everybody/somebody /anyone/someone/no one/everyone, ‘s (i.e. apostrophe s) will be used with else.<br>
E.g.: I can rely on your words, not ***somebody else's***.<br>
I like your earrings and ***nobody else’s***.<br>
That was ***someone else’s*** shoe.<br>
Your website is better than ***anyone else’s***.<br>

### Possessive pronouns

Apostrophe is not used with possessive pronouns (his, hers, yours, ours, theirs) <br>
E.g. yours faithfully (<s>yours’ faithfully</s>)  <br>
yours truly (<s>yours’ truly</s>) <br>

## Uses of the Possessive Case 

#### Use Case 1

We can say: <br>
That old bike of ***John's*** is unsafe. <br>

But when we are talking about relationships between people we can also use a noun without 's: <br>
An uncle of ***David’s***. (or An uncle of ***David***.) <br>

#### Use Case 2

The possessive of a proper name or of a noun denoting a trade, profession, or relationship may be used to denote a building or place of business (church, house, school, college, shop, hospital, theatre etc.). 

The noun following such a possessive form can be left out.

Tomorrow I am dining at my ***uncle’s***. (it means uncle's house).  <br>
She was educated at ***St. Stephan's***.  (it means St. Stephan college). <br>

In some of the cases we can also use the singular (without ‘s). <br>
I must go to the ***butcher’s*** tomorrow. (it means butcher's shop)  <br>
I must go to the ***butcher*** tomorrow. (it means butcher's shop)  <br>

We also usually leave out the noun when the meaning is clear in cases like: <br>
'Whose bat is this?’ ‘***Sachin's***.' (rather than Sachin's hat.) <br>

#### Use Case 3 (Living vs. Non-living)

The Possessive Case is used mainly with the names of <strong>living things</strong>. <br>
The ***Minister’s*** assistant; the ***lion’s*** mane. <br>

Apostrophe is not used with non-living things. Instead, we use ‘of’.  <br>
I don’t like this ***door’s*** colour. (incorrect)<br>
I don’t like the colour ***of this door***. (correct)<br>
This ***table’s*** leg is broken. (incorrect)<br>
The leg ***of this table*** is broken. (correct)<br>

Apostrophe is also not used with plant or tree.<br>
mango's tree ( incorrect)<br>
mango tree ( correct)<br>
rose's plant (incorrect)<br>
rose plant (correct)<br>

But there are many exceptions to this living, non-living rule. Let us see them one by one. <br>

Possessive is used with: <br>

* collective Noun <br>
Do you support the ***government’s*** policy. (government - collective noun)<br>

* heavenly Bodies <br>
The ***moon’s*** beauty can’t be described. <br>

* anything personified <br>
***India's*** heroes; ***Nature's*** laws; ***Fortune's*** favourite; at ***duty's*** call; at ***death's*** door.<br>

* monuments / institutions<br>
The ***red fort’s*** glory cannot be surpassed.<br>

* names of countries, state, city etc.<br>
***India’s*** beauty is more mesmerizing than ***Nepal’s***.<br>

* nouns denoting time, space, weight, amount, distance, etc. <br>
a ***day's*** march. (denoting time) <br>
in a ***month's*** time. (denoting time) <br>
a ***pound's*** weight. (denoting weight) <br>
a ***stone's*** throw away. (denoting distance) <br>

#### Use Case 4

In case of clause/phrase, we don’t use apostrophe s (’s). <br>

Examples: <br>
Have you gone through ***Shakespeare’s poems*** who was a great poet. (incorrect)<br>
Have you gone through the ***poems of Shakespeare*** who was a great poet. (correct)<br>

I don’t like ***the man’s behaviour*** sitting beside you. (incorrect)<br>
I don’t like the ***behaviour of the man*** sitting beside you. (correct)<br>

Exceptions:<br>

The Possessive is also used with some phrases:<br>
At his ***fingers'*** ends; for ***mercy's*** sake; to his ***heart's*** content; at his ***wit's*** end; a ***boat's*** crew. <br>

A Caveat

Do not use double apostrophe with two consecutive nouns. (make use of ‘of’ to avoid it)

My husband’s secretary’s brother has expired. (incorrect)<br>
The brother of my husband’s secretary has expired. (correct)
