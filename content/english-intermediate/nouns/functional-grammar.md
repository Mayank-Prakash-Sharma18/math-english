We define a word as noun or verb etc on the basis of its function in a sentence.
That is, the same word can function as different parts of speech in different situations. 

For example, there are a few words, that can function as nouns in some cases and verbs in other cases.

***Love*** is life. (love - an abstract noun) <br>
I ***love*** you. (love – a verb)

Where is your ***shop***? (shop - an abstract noun)<br>
I will ***shop*** on Monday. (shop – a verb)

Few of such words even differ in pronunciation when used as a verb.

Address (əˈdres, ऐड्रिस) - (address as an abstract noun)<br>
Ex: May I have your ***address***?

Address (a’dres, अड्रेस) - (to deliver a speech, working as a verb)<br>
Ex: How do I ***address*** you?
