There are two types of Noun Numbers in English - Singular and Plural.

* A Noun in Singular Number – a noun that denotes one person, place or thing.
E.g. boy, cat, tree, book, city.

* A Noun in Plural Number – a noun that denotes more than one person, place or thing.
E.g.	boys, cats, trees, books, cities.

A singular noun takes a singular verb and a plural noun takes a plural verb. <br>
E.g.  boy -  is / has / does / goes / comes etc<br>
boys -  are / have / go / do / come etc

## Forming plurals of normal nouns 

Here we will learn the various ways of forming plurals of normal nouns.

### Adding –s 

Plural of nouns is generally formed by adding -s to the singular: <br>
boy - boys 			<br>
girl - girls

* We make plural of a noun by adding -s when a single noun ends with -e:<br>
house - houses<br>
gate - gates<br>
lace -  laces

* We make plural of a noun by adding -s when a single noun form ends with -ff:<br>
buff - buffs<br>
cuff -  cuffs<br>
puff - puffs<br>
whiff - whiffs

* Nouns ending with double vowels are made plural by adding -s.<br>
tree - trees<br>
portfolio - portfolios<br>
radio	-	radios

### Adding -es 

Nouns ending in -s, -ss, -sh, -x or –z form the plural by adding -es to the singular:<br>
bus - buses<br>
class - classes<br>
brush – brushes<br>
tax - taxes <br>
buzz - buzzes

A few exceptions:<br>
locus - loci<br>
radius - radii<br>
ox - oxen

If there is -is at the end of a word, then we convert last -is into -es <br>
basis - bases<br>
hypothesis - hypotheses<br>
parenthesis - parentheses<br>
analysis - analyses<br>
thesis - theses

##### -s Vs. -es

In some cases there is very minute difference regarding addition of –s or –es. Let’s see some of such cases.

* Nouns ending in -ch

When a single noun ends with -ch (which produces a sound of k at the end), we make it plural by adding -s:<br>
 monarch - monarchs<br>
 stomach - stomachs

Nouns ending in -ch (soft) form the plural by adding -es to the singular:<br>
match - matches<br>
batch - batches

* consonant + o Vs. vowel + o

When a noun ends with ‘consonant + o’, we form the plural by adding -es to the singular:<br>
mango - mangoes<br>
buffalo - buffaloes

Exceptions:<br>
A few nouns ending in ‘consonant + o’ merely add -s<br>
photo - photos<br>
embryo - embryos<br>
piano - pianos

When is single noun ends with a ‘vowel + o’, we make it plural by adding –s (we already know that Nouns ending with double vowel are made plural by adding 's'.):<br>
bamboo - bamboos<br>
radio - radios<br>
stereo - stereos

* consonant + y Vs. vowel + y

Nouns ending with ‘consonant + y’, form their plural by changing -y into –i and adding –es (i.e. changing 'y' into 'ies')<br>
family – families<br>
lady - ladies <br>
fly - flies

Nouns ending with ‘vowel + y’, are made plural by adding 's'.<br>
boy - boys<br>
key - keys<br>
way - ways

* Nouns ending in -f or -fe

The following nouns ending in -f or -fe form their plural by changing –f or -fe into v and adding –es (i.e. changing 'f/fe' into 'ves')<br>
thief - thieves<br>
leaf - leaves	<br>
life - lives<br>
wife - wives<br>
knife – knives 

Exceptions:<br>
Some words ending in -f or -fe add -s. For example:<br> 
chief - chiefs<br>
roof - roofs<br>
safe - safes

The nouns dwarf, hoof, scarf and wharf take either -s or -ves in the plural.<br>
dwarf - dwarfs or dwarves		<br>
hoof - hoofs or hooves

### Adding -en 

There are a few nouns that form their plural by adding -en to the singular. <br>
ox - oxen<br>
child - children.

### Changing the inside vowel 

A few nouns form their plural by changing the inside vowel of the singular.<br>
man - men<br>
woman - women<br>
foot - feet

She is a widow with five child. (incorrect)<br>
She is a widow with five children. (correct)

There is no fixed rule regarding how the singular noun will be changed here. You will have to learn the plural of such words on a word by word basis.

## Plurals of Compound Nouns

To make a compound noun plural we usually make the second noun plural:<br>
office-worker(s)<br>
tea leaf - tea leaves

But, if two nouns are joined by of or in, we make the plural form by making the first noun plural:<br>
rule of thumb - rules of thumb <br>
commander(s)-in-chief

Another way of understanding it:<br>
Compound Noun generally forms its plural by adding -s to the principal word<br>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Singular</th>
    <th>Plural</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Daughter-in-law</td>
    <td>Daughters-in-law</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stepdaughter</td>
    <td>Stepdaughters</td>
  </tr>
</table>

{{% alert note %}}
Special cases:<br>
1. Compare these:
<table id="mak">
  <tr>
    <th>Singular</th>
    <th>Plural</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Maidservant</td>
    <td>Maidservants</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Manservant</td>
    <td>Menservants (both nouns made plural)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

2. In case of noun ending with “ful”, we add -s to ful.<br>
She has given me five spoonfuls of sugar.

<!-- ##### If first noun in a compond noun has singular form but plural meaning

Even if the first noun has a singular form, it may have a plural meaning. We need not use its plural form:<br>
a car park (a place for parking cars)<br>
an address book (a book for addresses)

Exceptions:
* nouns that are only used in the plural, or have a different meaning in singular/plural or countable/uncountable:<br>
E.g. a clothes shop (compare a shoe shop), glasses case (glasses means spectacles), arms trade, savings account 
* when we refer to an institution dealing with more than one item or activity.<br>
 E.g. publications department<br>
Compare:<br>
the appointment board (the board which deals with a particular appointment)<br>
the appointments board (the board which deals with all appointments) -->

## Plurals of Letters, figures and other symbols

The plurals for capital letters and numbers used as nouns are not formed with apostrophes.

She learned her ***ABCs***. <br>
The ***1990s*** were the best. <br>
She learned her time tables for ***5s*** and ***6s***.

{{% alert note %}}
Exception: Use an apostrophe and s with capital letters and numbers when the meaning would be unclear otherwise. <br>
There are more ***e's*** than ***a's*** in this page. <br>
Dot your ***i's*** and cross your ***t's***. <br>
Add two ***5's*** and four ***2's***.

## Plural of Uncountable Nouns

Uncountable nouns take singular verb. These nouns will not take: 
* Articles 'A/An’, 
* Number denoting adjective - ‘many', 'few', 'number of’ and 
* 'plural form’, i.e. s/es etc.

E.g. Hair, Business, Bread, Stationery, Crockery, Luggage, Baggage, Postage, Fuel, Cost.

His ***hair*** is black.

I have some ***equipment*** that I needed for the project.

Such nouns have no plural form but sometimes we need the plural form of some of these nouns. The plural form is made by adding certain words before the uncountable nouns.

The begger ate ***two slices*** of bread. (bread - uncountable noun)

Please show me ***some items of*** office stationery. (stationery - uncountable noun)

<!-- #### Difference in meaning of Singular and Plural of Uncountable Nouns

Some uncountable nouns can be used in plural form but with a changed meaning.

* Material Nouns
Names of substances are also uncountables and are not therefore used in the plural -	copper, iron, tin, wood. <br>
When such words are used in the plural, they become countables with changed meanings. <br>
coppers → copper coins; woods → forests.

* Abstract Nouns
Abstract Nouns have no plural, as they are uncountable - hope, charity, love, kindness.<br>
When used in the plural, they are used as countables and their meaning changes too somewhat.<br>
provocations → instances or cases of provocation.<br>
kindnesses → acts of kindness. -->
