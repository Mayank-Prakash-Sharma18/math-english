Once you are done with basic English Grammar and have developed some basic Vocabulary, it's time to apply your knowledge and move a step closer towards total command on English Language. 

Following topics are considered the application part of English, as here we are supposed to apply not only our learning of grammar and vocab, but also other nitty-gritties of the language like context, tone, word connotation, our comprehension skills etc. 

* Cloze Test

* Para Jumbles (or PQRS)

* Reading Comprehension (RC)

This is the reading part of the tests, often given in objective test form. Later on we will also cover the written part, i.e. subjective part, where we will learn how to write essays, letters etc. That will be covered in a separate module.
