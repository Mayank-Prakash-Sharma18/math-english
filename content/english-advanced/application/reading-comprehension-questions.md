In this article we will try to learn RC in more detail, by solving some RC sets. Some of the concepts, that we aim to learn here are: 

* Understanding Keywords like - conclusion, inference, assumption, implication etc. 
* How to make use of options.
* How to eliminate incorrect options, and zero in on the correct option.
* How to select the most appropriate option, if more than 1 option are correct.
* How to select the least incorrect option, if all the given options seem incorrect. 


## How to select the least incorrect option? 

##### Q. Read the following passage and answer the question that follows. Your answer to the given question should be based on the passage only.

Prioritizing sanitation is critical for multiple reasons. The lack of sanitation is the leading cause of diarrhea among children under five, leading to stunting among children and also results in several preventable child deaths. Sanitation is also critical for the safety and dignity of women. With India making massive strides towards becoming an economic superpower, ending the practice of open defecation is absolutely imperative. Unlike earlier-era sanitation programs, the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) is not a toilet construction program but a behavior-change mass movement.

Q. Which of the following are the most rational inferences that can be made from the passage?
1.	Sanitation is a vital element for the economic growth of the nation.
2.	The Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) does not include any infrastructure development.
3.	The Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) will help in improving the quality of life of people.
4.	The awareness campaigns are an important component of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM).
5.	The government ensures all citizens access to safe drinking water under this mission.

Select the correct answer using the code given below. <br>
(a)	1, 2 and 5 <br>
(b)	3, 4 and 5 <br>
(c)	1 and 3 only <br>
(d)	1, 3 and 4 <br>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Statement 1 is correct. The line "With India making massive strides towards becoming an economic superpower, ending the practice of open defecation is absolutely imperative" highlights the importance of sanitation in the economic growth of a nation. <br>
*Though we cannot say for certain that sanitation is a “vital” element for the economic growth of the nation. So, this sentence cannot be said to be entirely correct, but it’s not incorrect either. Let’s keep it aside for now and move ahead.*

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage does not mention the features of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) and not involving any infrastructural development in a sanitation drive implies an extreme feature of the mission. So, this cannot be a rational inference.

Statement 3 is correct. According to the passage the SBM is a sanitation drive that aims to promote cleanliness and hygiene among the people. The passage mentions the consequences of lack of sanitation which include health issues, compromise on safety and dignity of women, etc. Thus, it is logical to infer that with improved sanitary conditions, the quality of life of people will also improve.

Statement 4 is correct. The line "the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) is not a toilet construction program but a behavior-change mass movement" highlights the importance of awareness campaigns to promote clean and hygienic practices among the people.

Statement 5 is incorrect. The passage does not describe the features of the SBM. So, it is not rational to infer if access to safe drinking water to all constitutes a part of this scheme.

*Now, we know that statements 3 and 4 are correct for certain. So, the correct options must be either (b) or (d). Basically, it boils down to whether statement 1 is correct or 5, or which one of these is more correct or less wrong. We know for sure that statement 5 is incorrect, as it is out of context. Hence, we can eliminate option (b). The only option left is option (d).*

Answer: (d)
