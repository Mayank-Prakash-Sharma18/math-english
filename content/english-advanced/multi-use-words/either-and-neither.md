In this article, we will see:
* the various ways 'either and neither' can function in a sentence.
* the various sentence structures/patterns involving 'either and neither'
* various use cases of 'either and neither', including some dos and don'ts. 

Either and neither should be used only in speaking of two persons or things. 

## Either and Neither as various parts of speech

They may function as:
* (Distributive) Pronoun
* (Distributive) Adjective
* Adverb
* Conjunction

When working as a pronoun, adjective or conjunction, 'Either' means the one or the other of two (i.e. when there is a choice between two). <br>
When working as an adverb, 'Either' means ‘likewise’. 

When working as a pronoun, adjective or conjunction, 'Neither' means none of the two. It is the negative of either. <br>
When working as an adverb, 'Neither' means ‘also not, similarly not’. 


### Either and Neither as Distributive Pronouns 

#### Pattern 1

Either/Neither are followed by singular verb. 

Either/Neither + Singular Verb

Which of these two bikes is fast enough for our race? I think either ***is*** fast enough.

She has two pens but neither ***writes*** well.

#### Pattern 2

However, we use Plural Noun/Pronoun after ‘Either/Neither + of’. 

Either/Neither + of + Plural Noun/Pronoun + Singular Verb

***Neither of them*** wants to be dropped off the team. (them – plural pronoun; wants – singular verb)

In such a pattern usage of singular verb is considered more formal. Though you might see plural verbs being used in informal writings and speech.

### Either and Neither as Distributive Adjectives

Either/neither is a singular word. So, they are followed by a singular noun and singular verb. 

Pattern: Either/Neither + Singular Noun + Singular Verb

Either ***road leads*** to the bus stand.

Neither ***candidate has*** been selected.

However, we use Plural Noun/Pronoun after ‘Either/Neither + of’. In such cases, Either/Neither function as a pronoun, rather than as an adjective.

### Either and Neither as Adverbs

Either and neither can function as adverbs too. 

It was a really nice coat, and it wasn’t very costly ***either***. (either – adverb; We use ‘either’ as an adverb after a negative verb)

If you don't want to go to the school, ***neither*** do I. (neither - adverb)


### Either and Neither as Conjunctions

Either...or and neither...nor can function as conjunctions too, to connect two clauses. 

***Either*** we can travel by train ***or*** we can rent a car. 

After the divorce, he ***neither*** called ***nor*** wrote.

## Either/Neither Vs. Any, One, No one, None  

When more than two are spoken of, any, one, no one, none should be used.

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Either</span>*** of these three boys is definitely guilty. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">One</span>*** of these three boys is definitely guilty. (correct)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Neither</span>*** of his four sons looked after him. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">None</span>*** of his four sons looked after him. (correct)


## Either/Neither Vs. All, Both

### Difference 1

To talk about two people/things, we can use the quantifiers both, either and neither.

***Both*** the shops are open. <br>
I don’t think ***either*** of the shops is open. <br>
***Neither*** of the shops is open.

With ‘both’ we use plural verb, but with ‘either/neither’ we use singular verb. 

{{% alert note %}}
When either is used as an adjective before a singular countable noun, it may mean ‘both’.

There were houses on ***either*** side of the lane. (either = both) <br>
There were houses on ***both*** sides of the lane.

### Difference 2

'Both' is not used in negative sense.

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Both</span>*** of them are not going. (incorrect; it is an ambiguous sentence – is one of them not going or neither of them is going) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Neither</span>*** of them is going. (correct)

{{% alert note %}}
'Both' is used for exactly two people or things.

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">All of the two</span>*** players are excellent. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Both of the two</span>*** players are excellent. (correct) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Both</span>*** players are excellent. (correct)
