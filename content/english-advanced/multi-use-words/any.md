### Any as an Adjective/Determiner

As an adjective/determiner, ‘any’ can have two meanings. Let’s see them both. 

#### Any meaning indefinite quantity

‘Any’ may mean an indefinite or an unknown quantity, i.e. one, several, or all of the members of a group. (weak form of any)

We use such form of ‘any’ in questions and negative sentences, and only with plural countable nouns and uncountable nouns (not with singular countable nouns). 

Pattern 1: Any + Plural Countable Noun <br>
Are there ***any*** boxes left? (boxes – plural countable noun)

Pattern 2: Any + Uncountable Noun <br>

Have you got ***<span class="mak-text-color">a</span>*** chocolate cookie? (correct) <br>

{{% /alert %}}

#### Any meaning unlimited quantity

‘Any’ may mean unlimited quantity, or ‘it does not matter which’ because it applies to all the members of the group. (strong form of any)

We use such form of ‘any’ in affirmative sentences, and with all types of nouns (including singular countable nouns). 

Pattern 1: Any + Singular Countable Noun <br>
It’s a problem that ***any*** intelligent student can solve. (student – singular countable noun; it applies to all intelligent students)

Pattern 2: Any + Plural Countable Noun <br>

Pattern 3: Any + Uncountable Noun <br>
You may call me for ***any*** information you want. (information – uncountable noun)

{{% alert note %}}
Sometimes we use ‘any other’ in the same sense, i.e. when we mean all the members of the group.

Bitcoin can be mined in the same way as ***any other*** online crypto-currency. (i.e. all crypto-currencies can be mined the same way)

<br><hr><br>

## Uses of ‘Any’

We often use ‘any’ in following ways:

### Use 1: In questions and negative sentences

Are there ***any*** sweets left?

Don’t worry. He hasn’t filed ***any*** complaint against you. 

{{% alert note %}}
While we use ‘any’ in questions and negative sentences, we use ‘some’ in affirmative sentences (before countable nouns to refer to an indefinite quantity of something). <br>
Are there ***any*** sweets left? Yes, there are ***some*** sweets left. (sweets – countable noun)

In case of offers and requests, we can use ‘some’ even in questions: <br>
Would you like to have ***some*** chips?

### Use 2

We often use ‘any’ in clauses with ‘if’: 

We can provide you some arms, if that’s ***any*** help.

### Use 3

We also use ‘any’ in the following phrases:

* any...at all: <br>
Without ***any*** hesitation ***at all***, he came forward and offered to do community service.

* few if any (i.e. not many and possibly none): <br>
***Few if any*** officers will do what he did.

### Use 4: Emphasis

‘Any’ is used for emphasis purposes, after a verb. Here it means ‘at all’.

Have conditions improved ***at all***? (correct) <br>
Have conditions improved ***any***? (correct)

## Any Vs. Anyone

‘Anyone’ is always used for people. <br>
‘Any’ can be used for people as well as inanimate objects. 

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Anyone</span>*** car will be more expensive than this jeep. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Any</span>*** car will be more expensive than this jeep. (correct)


## Anyone Vs. Any One

Note the differences between ‘anyone’ and ‘any one’. 

### Difference 1

‘Anyone’ is a pronoun. While ‘any one’ is a combination of two adjectives – any and one. ‘one’ is a determiner that refers to a single item. 
 
So, unlike ‘anyone’, we can use ‘any one’ for people, as well as inanimate objects. 

My son likes all ice-cream flavours, not ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">anyone</span>*** flavour. (incorrect) <br>
My son likes all ice-cream flavours, not ***<span class="mak-text-color">any one</span>*** flavour. (correct)

### Difference 2

‘any one’ is also used for extra emphasis. 

We couldn’t bear to lose ***any*** of these battlefield positions. <br>
We couldn’t bear to lose ***any one*** of these battlefield positions. (same meaning, more emphasis) <br>
We couldn’t bear to lose ***any single one*** of these battlefield positions. (same meaning, even more emphasis)

{{% alert note %}}
We also use ‘any one’ in the phrase “at any one time”. This phrase is used to add more clarity to a statement or emphasize something.

We can only borrow a maximum of three books ***at any one time***.” (adds clarity) <br>
***At any one time***, there used to be more than a dozen customers at our shop. (adds extra emphasis)

## Any Vs. Every

Every → Refers to everyone in the group

Any → May refer to one, many or all of the members of a group. 

I have been going to the gym ***every*** day this week. (i.e. all days) <br>
I can go to the gym ***any*** day this week. (i.e. any day, or some days, or all days)

So, if we mean to say ‘each individual member of a group’, we should not use ‘any’ with singular countable nouns. Rather we will use ‘every’. 

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Any</span>*** student of this class should bring his id card tomorrow. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Every</span>*** student of this class should bring his id card tomorrow. (correct)
