## Usage Patterns of Each

Now, let's see some of the sentence patterns in which you are more likely to see 'each' being used. 

### Each as a Distributive Pronoun 

#### Pattern 1

We know that, 'Each' is used to denote every one of a number of persons or things taken singly. So, ‘Each’ as distributive pronoun takes a singular verb.

Pattern: Each + Singular Verb

***Each*** of us plays it one after the other. (plays - singular verb)

#### Pattern 2

However, when ‘each’ follows a plural subject, then we use plural verb with them. <br>
These guys hunt in group. They ***each do*** their part of the work. (do – plural verb)

In other words, we can say that, if 'each' comes after the subject, the helping verb/main verb should agree with the subject.

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">We each has</span>*** advised him to give up smoking. (incorrect; we – plural subject; has – singular verb) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">We each have</span>*** advised him to give up smoking. (correct; we – plural subject; have - plural verb)

The position of ‘each’ also matters. 

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">We have each</span>*** advised him to give up smoking. (incorrect)

### Each as a Distributive Adjective 

‘Each’ as distributive adjective takes a singular countable noun and a singular verb.

Pattern: Each + Singular Noun + Singular Verb

***Each*** drummer plays it one after the other. (drummer - singular noun; plays - singular verb)

However, we use Plural Noun/Pronoun after ‘Each+ of’. In such cases, ‘Each’ function as a pronoun, rather than as an adjective.

### Position of Each

In a sentence, ‘each’ may have three positions.

***Each*** of these players scored 3 goals. (starting position; here ‘each’ is working as a pronoun) <br>
These players scored ***each*** 3 goals. (mid position, after verb) <br>
These players scored 3 goals ***each***. (end position; in such position of ‘each’, we write ‘each’ only after a numeral; here ‘each’ is working as an adverb)

***Each*** of the women received a coupon. (starting position; here ‘each’ is working as a pronoun) <br>
These women received ***each*** a coupon. (mid position, after verb)

Compare the following:

The women received a coupon ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">each</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
The women received five coupons ***<span class="mak-text-color">each</span>***. (correct; in such position of ‘each’, we write ‘each’ only after a numeral)
{{% /alert %}}

I bought ***each*** of these bikes for 2 lakh rupees. (mid position, after verb; here ‘each’ is working as a pronoun) <br>
I bought these bikes for 2 lakh rupees ***each***. (end position; in such position of ‘each’, we write ‘each’ only after a numeral; here ‘each’ is working as an adverb)

## Each Vs. Every

Students often get confused between 'each' and 'every'. So, let us compare 'each' and 'every', and see a few of the differences between them. 

### Difference 1

Each can function as a pronoun or as an adjective. While, Every only functions as an adjective.

### Difference 2

Each is used for ‘definite/specific’ cases, while Every for ‘indefinite/general’ cases. 

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Every</span>*** of you is a champion. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Each/Everyone</span>*** of you is a champion. (correct)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Each</span>*** action has equal and opposite reaction. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Every</span>*** action has equal and opposite reaction. (correct)

### Difference 3

Each is used for two or more than two. While, Every is used for more than two. 

### Difference 4

We may use Each to emphasize an individual (but not Every).

That is, we use ‘each’ to refer to every member of the group. While, we use ‘every’ to refer to all the members of the group collectively. 

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Every</span>*** cigarette we smoke is scarring our lungs. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Each</span>*** cigarette we smoke is scarring our lungs. (correct)

The phrase ‘each and every’ is used for emphasis. It just adds more force to ‘each’. We use singular verb with it.

***Each and every*** member of the parliament ***was*** evacuated.

### Difference 5

We use Every (not Each) with Practically, Nearly, Almost.

Practically, Nearly, Almost .....  + Each/Every + Noun + ..........

I know ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">practically/nearly each</span>*** scientist in India. (incorrect) <br>
I know ***<span class="mak-text-color">practically/nearly every</span>*** scientist in India. (correct)

***Practically every*** part of the neem tree is used in Ayurveda.

### Difference 6

We do not use ‘each’ for time-interval. 

Take medicine after ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">each</span>*** five hours.(incorrect) <br>
Take medicine after ***<span class="mak-text-color">every</span>*** five hours. (correct)


## Each Vs. Either

Each – each individual in the collection of two or more. <br>
Either – one individual in a collection of two. 

In ‘either’ we talk about only one item in the group, while in ‘each’ we talk about each item in the group.
