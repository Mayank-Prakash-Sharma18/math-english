In this article, we will see:
* the various ways 'all' can function in a sentence.
* the various sentence structures/patterns involving 'all'
* various use cases of 'all', including some dos and don'ts. 


## All as various parts of speech

‘All’ can function as:
* a pronoun, 
* an adjective or 
* an adverb.

***All*** of the houses were burnt. (all – pronoun) <br>
***All*** men are born equal. (all – adjective; men - noun) <br>
When I am with you, I forget ***all*** about my problems. (all – adverb)

As a pronoun, or as an adjective ‘All’ expresses the entire quantity or extent of a group or thing. As an adverb ‘All’ means completely, or consisting entirely of. 

### All as a Pronoun

As a pronoun, ‘all’ can work as a subject or as an object, and can have various positions in a sentence. Have a look at the examples given below. 

#### All as the subject 

***All*** is quiet outside. (all – pronoun, working as a subject)

***All of*** them are playing squash. (all followed by ‘of’ – pronoun, working as a subject)

Students often commit word-order errors when using ‘all’ as a pronoun, when it is used after the subject of the sentence. 

We always use ‘all’:

* before the main verb, and after the modal verb if there is any. <br><br>
These paintings ***all belong*** to Mr. Steven. (pronoun both used after noun or pronoun subject, and before the main verb) <br><br>
They ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">bought all</span>*** a book. (incorrect) <br>
They ***<span class="mak-text-color">all bought</span>*** a book. (correct; ‘all’ used before the main verb bought) <br><br>
We ***can all play*** squash. (pronoun both used after a modal verb) <br><br>
You ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">all must clean</span>*** the floor. (incorrect) <br>
You ***<span class="mak-text-color">must all clean</span>*** the floor. (correct; ‘all’ used after the modal verb must and before the main verb ‘clean’)

<!-- * after the verb ‘be’, if it’s the only verb in the sentence (so it will be the main verb).
They ***are all*** good players. (pronoun both used after the verb ‘to be’) <br><br>
The students ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">all were</span>*** sad. (incorrect) <br>
The students ***<span class="mak-text-color">were all</span>*** sad. (correct) -->

* after an auxiliary verb or the first auxiliary verb, if there are more than one verbs in a sentence. <br><br>
They ***are all going*** to run away. (correct; are – auxiliary verb; going – main verb)<br>
They ***have all been apprehended***. (correct; have – auxiliary verb; been – another auxiliary verb; apprehended – main verb)

Note: The same rules/concepts apply to ‘both’ too. 

#### All as the object

Which candy do you like? I like ***all***.

We like them ***all***. (pronoun both used after main verb and pronoun object)


#### All of

We can use ‘all of’ in the following patterns:

##### Pattern 1

All + of + determiner + noun

Do not forget to add the determiner (the, my, this etc.), or else the sentence will be deemed incorrect.

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">All of</span>*** scientists claimed that the new discovery is valid. (incorrect – determiner missing) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">All of the</span>*** scientists claimed that the new discovery is valid. (correct; the - determiner; scientists - noun) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">All the</span>*** scientists claimed that the new discovery is valid. (correct; scientists - noun)

##### Pattern 2

We can also use ‘all of’ in the following pattern:

All + of + plural pronoun

***All of us*** are leaving the town. <br>
Did the guards find ***all of them***?

{{% alert note %}}
We may or may not use this pattern when modifying a noun, but it must be used when modifying a plural pronoun.
{{% /alert %}}

We also use all with ‘it’ in this pattern. All can also come after ‘it’.  <br>
Seems like you have seen ***all of it***. Yes. I have seen it all.


### All as an Adjective

As an adjective/determiner, ‘all’ is followed by an uncountable noun or plural countable noun.

***All*** boys are playing outside. (all – adjective; boys - plural countable noun)

{{% alert note %}}
‘All’ can also work as a predeterminer (i.e. it may come before another determiner such as ‘the’, ‘this’, ‘his’ etc)

I like ***all*** these paintings. (all used before the determiner ‘these’) <br>
***All*** her brothers are criminals. (all used before the determiner ‘her’)
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert note %}}
each, every, all, half, both, either, neither can work as distributive determiners.

Distributive determiners refer to a group of people/things, or to individual members of the group. They express how something is distributed, shared, or divided.

Notice the difference between them:

* We use ‘each’ and ‘every’ to talk about the individual members of a group. (We can use ‘each’ for a group of two, but not ‘every’.) <br>
* We use ‘all’ to talk about the whole group. <br>
* We use ‘half’ to talk about a divided group. <br>
* We use ‘both’, ‘either’, and ‘neither’ to talk about two people/things (i.e. in a pair).

### All as an Adverb

He is ***all*** alone in that big city. (all - adverb) <br>
We were so engrossed in the play, that we forgot ***all*** about the cab driver waiting outside. (all - adverb) 

<br><hr><br>

## Uses of All

We often use 'all' in following patterns:

### Use 1

Pattern 1: All + uncountable noun or plural countable noun

Here, ‘all’ refers to the group as a concept (rather than referring the members of the group as separate entities).

***All meat*** contains protein. (meat – uncountable noun) <br>
***All kids*** need care. (kids - plural countable noun)

{{% alert note %}}
Whether we use singular or plural verb with ‘all’, will depend on the noun it is modifying. That is, just use the appropriate verb as per the noun.
{{% /alert %}}

### Use 2

Pattern 2: All + (the, my, your, etc.) + uncountable noun or plural countable noun

Thieves stole ***all the bread***. (bread – uncountable noun) <br>
***All the bottles*** were destroyed. (bottles - plural countable noun)

I have been waiting for this moment ***all my life***. (life – uncountable noun) <br>
***All my students*** will be in the assembly soon. (students - plural countable noun)

### Use 3

Pattern 3: All (of) + this, that + uncountable noun

Such pattern is often found in questions and exclamations. 

Who has created ***all this mess***? (mess - uncountable noun)

### Use 4

Pattern 4: All (of) + these, those + plural countable noun

Such pattern is often found in questions and exclamations. 

Have a look at ***all these mistakes***! (mistakes - plural countable noun)

<!-- ### Use 5

In negative sentences having ‘all’ we generally use ‘not all’, rather than ‘all … not’.

***All*** the tickets were ***not*** sold. (less formal) <br>
***Not all*** the tickets were sold. (more formal)

We can also use none (of). However, the meanings of ‘not all’ and ‘none (of)’ differ.

Compare:

***Not all*** my friends were at the party. (i.e. some of my friends were there) <br>
***None of*** my friends were at the party. (i.e. no one was there) -->

<br><hr><br>

## All Vs. Both and Half

### Difference 1

Both is only used to refer to groups of two. <br>
***Both*** of them are former rugby players.

All can be used for a single unit, or may refer to groups of any size (so it refers to an unspecified number). 

***All*** of them are former rugby players. <br>
***All*** of this cake will go to trash. 

Though we can use ‘all’ to refer to a group of two, but we prefer ‘both’ in that case.

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">All</span>*** of these two students have scored high marks. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Both</span>*** of these two students have scored high marks. (correct)

### Difference 2

With ‘all’ and ‘half’ we can use singular countable nouns, but not with ‘both’ 

All my ***room*** has been painted. (correct; room – singular countable noun) <br>
Half this ***work*** will be done by evening. (correct; work – singular countable noun)

Both my ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">room</span>*** has been painted. (incorrect) <br>
Both my ***<span class="mak-text-color">rooms</span>*** have been painted. (correct; rooms – plural countable noun)

### Difference 3

We can use plural countable nouns with all the three – all, both and half. But we cannot use zero article with ‘half’ in such cases (we can use it with all and both). 

***All trains*** are late today. (correct; trains – plural countable noun) <br>
***Both trains*** are late today. (correct; trains – plural countable noun)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Half trains</span>*** are late today. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Half of the trains</span>*** are late today. (correct; trains – plural countable noun)

### Difference 4

With uncountable nouns we can use ‘half’ or ‘all’ but not ‘both’.  That is because ‘both’ always refers to two entities. 

***<span class="mak-text-color">Half his money</span>*** was stolen. (correct; money – uncountable noun) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">All his money</span>*** was stolen. (correct; money – uncountable noun) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Both his money</span>*** was stolen. (incorrect; money – uncountable noun)

Additionally, we cannot use zero article with ‘both’ and ‘half’ in such cases (we can use it with all).

***<span class="mak-text-color">All money</span>*** was stolen. (correct; money – uncountable noun; we can use zero article with all and uncountable noun) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Half money</span>*** was stolen. (incorrect; money – uncountable noun) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Both money</span>*** was stolen. (incorrect; money – uncountable noun)

### Difference 5

When used as adjectives/determiners, ‘all’ and ‘both’ can follow the noun/pronoun they modify (but not ‘half’).

***The guests all*** arrived early. (correct; noun - guests) <br>
***They both*** complained. (correct; pronoun - they)

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">The bread half</span>*** was eaten. (incorrect; noun - bread) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Half the bread</span>*** was eaten. (correct; noun - bread)

<!-- ### Difference 6:

We can use ‘both’ in the following two ways, and both usage mean the same thing.
* both + noun - used to refer to two people or things
* both + the/my/etc. + noun - used to refer to two people or things

***Both*** teams qualified for the next round. (correct) <br>
***Both the*** teams qualified for the next round. (correct)

However, in case of ‘all’, the meanings differ a bit. 
* all + noun – used to refer to people/things in general.
* all + the/my/etc. + noun – used to refer to particular people/things.

***All*** kids hate green vegetables. (correct; kids - plural countable noun) <br>
***All*** music makes people feel good inside. (correct; music - uncountable noun)

***All my*** kids hate green vegetables. (correct; kids - plural countable noun) <br>
***All my*** music makes people feel good inside. (correct; music - uncountable noun) -->


## Every Vs. All / Both

Every and All mean the same, but there are a few differences in the way we use them in sentences. 

### Difference 1

When we use Every and All, the sentence structure is different. 
 
Every is = All are

***Every pet*** needs care. (pet – singular noun; needs – singular verb) <br>
***All pets*** need care. (pets – plural noun; need – plural verb)

### Difference 2
 
Unlike ‘all’, we do not use ‘every’ just before articles, possessives, demonstratives, or with uncountable nouns

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Every</span>*** the parrots flew away. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">All</span>*** the parrots flew away. (correct)

She likes ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">every</span>*** music. (incorrect; music – uncountable noun) <br>
She likes ***<span class="mak-text-color">all</span>*** music. (correct)


## All of Vs. Whole of

We generally prefer to use - the whole (of) rather than all (of) the, before singular countable nouns.

We won’t be able to stay for ***all of the*** day. (less formal) <br>
We won’t be able to stay for ***the whole*** day. (more formal)

***All of the*** room was flooded. (less formal) <br>
***The whole of*** the room was flooded. (more formal)

{{% alert note %}}
all (of) and whole often have different meanings.
{{% /alert %}}

Compare: <br>
All (of the) cities had their power cut off. (i.e. every city in a particular area) <br>
Whole cities were left without power after the tornado. (i.e. some cities were completely affected)
