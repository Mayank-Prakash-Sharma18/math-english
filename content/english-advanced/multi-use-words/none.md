In this article, we will see:
* the various ways 'none' can function in a sentence.
* the various sentence structures/patterns involving 'none'
* various use cases of 'none', including some dos and don'ts. 


## None as various parts of speech

‘None’ can function as:
* a pronoun, 
* an adverb.

I looked around for some water, but there was ***none***. (none – pronoun) <br>
He was pushed ***none*** too gently against the wall by the police officer. (none – adverb)


### None as a Pronoun

#### Pattern 1

None is the pronoun form of ‘no’. 

When working as a pronoun, ‘None’ is used to refer to:
* not any 
* not one (nobody)
* not part of a group of people/things.

When working as an adverb, ‘None’ means not at all or to no extent.
{{% /alert %}}

We can use ’none’ to refer to either countable and uncountable nouns. Also, it can work as a subject or as an object in a sentence. 

We brainstormed for new ideas for about an hour. ***None*** came to mind. (none – subject, referring to uncountable noun idea)

You have three brothers. I have ***none***. (none – object, referring to countable noun brothers)

When ‘none’ is the subject of a sentence, it can take singular or plural verb.

***None*** of his colleagues ***lives*** nearby. (lives – singular verb) <br>
***None*** of the chairs ***were*** broken. (were – plural verb)

In formal contexts, singular verb is preferred with ‘none’. 
{{% /alert %}}

However, when ‘none’ means ‘not part of a whole’, then we definitely use singular verb.

***None*** of this is mine.  (is – singular verb)

#### Pattern 2: None of

***None of*** my students can do this. (none – pronoun)

We use none + of before:

* Possessives (e.g. his, their, your) <br>
***None of your*** kittens are eating.  

* Demonstratives (e.g. this, these, that, those) <br>
***None of these*** kittens are eating.  

* Article ‘the’

When referring to two things/people, we use ‘neither of’ rather than ‘none of’:

My husband and I saw a bank being robbed today. But ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">none of</span>*** us did anything. (incorrect) <br>
My husband and I saw a bank being robbed today. But ***<span class="mak-text-color">neither of</span>*** us did anything. (correct)

## Uses of None

We often use 'none' in following ways:

### Use 1

If there is a negative word in a sentence/clause, we do not use ‘none’. 

He doesn’t care for ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">none</span>*** of us. (incorrect) <br>
He doesn’t care for ***<span class="mak-text-color">any</span>*** of us. (correct)

### Use 2

‘None’ doesn’t work as an adjective. So, we never use it just before a noun. Rather we use:
* no + noun or 
* none of + noun

***No*** student in my class talked during the break. (correct; student - noun) <br>
***None of*** the students in my class talked during the break. (correct; students - noun) <br>
***None*** student in my class talked during the break. (incorrect)

### Use 3

We also use ‘none’ in the following phrase:

* None at all: <br>
Some of the coronavirus patients may show very mild symptoms, while some ***none at all***.

## None vs No one and Nobody

‘Nobody’ means "no person" or "not anyone." It works as a singular indefinite pronoun. <br>
***Nobody*** was there to greet the guests. (was – singular verb)

The meaning of ‘No one’ is the same as ‘Nobody.“ It also works as a singular indefinite pronoun. <br>
***No one*** was there to greet the guests. (was – singular verb)

{{% alert note %}}
‘No one’ and ‘Nobody are practically interchangeable. It’s just that, ‘No one’ is preferred in writing as it is considered more formal than ‘Nobody’.
{{% /alert %}}

### Difference 1

As compared to ‘no one’ or ‘nobody’, the usage of ‘none’ is considered more formal.

### Difference 2

‘No one’ and ‘Nobody’ are considered singular pronouns and so we use singular verb with it. 
‘None’ may take singular or plural verb.

***No one*** knows when this rain will stop. (correct; knows – singular verb) <br>
***Nobody*** knows when this rain will stop. (correct; knows – singular verb) <br>
***None*** know(s) when this rain will stop. (correct; can use know or knows)

### Difference 3

In case of uncountable nouns we use ‘none’. We cannot use ‘no one’ here, because 'one' in 'no one' is a numeral.

***None*** of the food was left. (correct) <br>
***No one*** of the food was left. (incorrect)

### Difference 4

‘No one’ and ‘Nobody’ always refer to people, and not inanimate objects. <br>
‘None’ may refer to  people or things. 

### Difference 5

We also use ‘No one’ to indicate a lack of emphasis on any specific item/person in a group.

He thought about it a lot, but ***no one*** solution seemed better than the others.”

Everyone of you will get one toffee each. ***No one*** of you will get more than another.”
