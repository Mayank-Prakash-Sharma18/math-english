We have already studied the various parts of speech in English language, e.g. noun, pronoun, adjective etc. We have also seen many words that function as one or the other part of speech.

However, there are numerous words in English language that may function as multiple parts of speech. For example, 'such' can function as a pronoun, and also as an adjective. 

That's why, context is important in English. In most cases, we cannot tell what 'part of speech' a word is working as, until and unless we see it being used in a sentence. 

In this module, we will have a look at some of such words that may function as various 'parts of speech'. You may already have seen some of them being used in earlier modules. However, here our focus will be more 'word-centric'. Read on!
