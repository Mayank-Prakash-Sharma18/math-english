In case you are confused regarding how exactly a word is working in a sentence, replace it with a similar word, and see if it still sounds ok. 

For example, consider the following sentence: <br>
***Such*** accusations by you may force us to sue your firm. 

Can you tell what part of speech is ‘such’ working as?

It is working as an adjective, that is modifying the noun ‘accusations’. We can replace it with another adjective and the sentence will still make sense. <br>
***False*** accusations by you may force us to sue your firm.
