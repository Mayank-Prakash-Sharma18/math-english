## Multipliers

The following types of words are called as Multipliers:
* double, triple, quadruple, …
* once, twice, thrice, … 
* two times, three times, … 

### Concept 1

We can use them with both singular and plural countable nouns, and uncountable nouns. 

In the next shop you will get the same chair for ***twice*** the price. (price – countable noun) <br>
Expectations put on her were ***10 times*** her ability. (ability – uncountable noun)

{{% alert note %}}
Multipliers are always used before the noun/pronoun, not after them.

This LG mobile will cost you ***<span class="mak-text-color">two times the amount</span>*** you need for Nokia mobile. (correct; amount - noun)
{{% /alert %}}

### Concept 2

Unlike ‘half’, we do not use ‘of’ with multipliers. 

I will provide you ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">double of</span>*** the salary you get right now. (incorrect) <br>
I will provide you ***<span class="mak-text-color">double</span>*** the salary you get right now. (correct; double – multiplier)

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- ### Concept 3

Before some determiners (e.g. each, every, a, per etc.) these multipliers can function as distributives. 

CAT releases this notification ***once every*** year. (once – multiplier; every - determiner) <br>
Leap years can sometimes fall ***thrice per*** decade. (thrice – multiplier; per - determiner) -->


## Fractions

Words like one-sixth, two-fifths, three-quarters etc. are called Fractions.

Unlike multipliers, which are never used with ‘of’, we can use ‘of’ with fractions. In fact, fractions are almost always used with ‘of’.  

Your share will be ***one-third the profit*** we make. (less preferred) <br>
Your share will be ***one-third of the profit*** we make. (more preferred)

{{% alert note %}}
‘Half’ can also be used with or without ‘of’. 
{{% /alert %}}

However, fractions are always used with ‘of’ before demonstrative and possessive determiners.

Incorrect Pattern: Fraction + demonstrative and possessive determiners (this, that, these, those, my, his etc.) <br>
Correct Pattern: Fraction + of + demonstrative and possessive determiners (this, that, these, those, my, his etc.) 

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">One fourth</span>*** these fruits are rotten. (incorrect) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">One fourth of</span>*** these fruits are rotten. (correct)

{{% alert note %}}
We can only use ‘half’ without ‘of’ before demonstrative and possessive determiners. That is, we can use ‘half’ with or without ‘of’ in such cases. 

***Half of*** these fruits are rotten. (correct) <br>
***Half*** these fruits are rotten. (correct)
