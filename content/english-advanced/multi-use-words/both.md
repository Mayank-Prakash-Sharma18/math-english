## Both as various parts of speech

‘Both’ can function as:
* a pronoun, 
* an adjective or 
* a conjunction.

As a pronoun, or as an adjective ‘Both’ means the one as well as the other. As a conjunction ‘Both’ means alike or equally. 

***Both*** of us were going to play for the national team. (both – pronoun) <br>
***Both*** matches have been cancelled. (both – adjective; matches - noun) <br>
She is ***both*** pretty ***and*** confident. (both … and – conjunction)


### Both as a Pronoun

As a pronoun, or as an adjective ‘Both’ means the one as well as the other. So, it is basically used in place of the phrase ‘the two’. 

As a pronoun, ‘both’ can work as a subject or as an object, and can have various positions in a sentence. Have a look at the examples given below. 

#### Both as the subject 

***Both*** fell at the same time. (both – pronoun, working as a subject)

***Both*** of them are playing squash. (both followed by ‘of’ – pronoun, working as a subject)

We do not use ‘both’ to talk about three of more people/things.

Students often commit word-order errors when using ‘both’ as a pronoun, when it is used after the subject of the sentence. 

We always use ‘both’:

* before the main verb, and after the modal verb if there is any. <br><br>
The brothers ***both played*** well. (pronoun both used after noun or pronoun subject, and before the main verb) <br><br>
They ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">bought both</span>*** a book. (incorrect) <br>
They ***<span class="mak-text-color">both bought</span>*** a book. (correct; ‘both’ used before the main verb bought)<br><br>
We ***can both play*** squash. (pronoun both used after a modal verb) <br><br>
We ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">both can study</span>*** together. (incorrect) <br>
We ***<span class="mak-text-color">can both study</span>*** together. (correct; ‘both’ used after the modal verb can and before the main verb ‘study’)

<!-- * after the verb ‘be’, if it’s the only verb in the sentence (so it will be the main verb).
They ***are both*** good players. (pronoun both used after the verb ‘to be’) <br><br>
The brothers ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">both were</span>*** sad. (incorrect) <br>
The brothers ***<span class="mak-text-color">were both</span>*** sad. (correct) -->

* after an auxiliary verb or the first auxiliary verb, if there are more than one verbs in a sentence. <br><br>
They ***are both going*** to run away. (correct; are – auxiliary verb; going – main verb) <br>
They ***have both been apprehended***. (correct; have – auxiliary verb; been – another auxiliary verb; apprehended – main verb)

#### Both as the object

Which candy do you like? I like ***both***.

We like them ***both***. (pronoun both used after main verb and pronoun object) 


#### Both of

##### Pattern 1

We can use ‘both of’ in the following pattern:

Both + of + determiner + noun

Do not forget to add the determiner (the, my, this etc.), or else the sentence will be deemed incorrect.

***Both of*** scientists claimed that they have discovered a new element. (incorrect – determiner missing) <br>
***Both of the*** scientists claimed that they have discovered a new element. (correct; the - determiner; scientists - noun) <br>
***Both*** scientists claimed that they have discovered a new element. (correct; scientists - noun)

##### Pattern 2

We can also use ‘both of’ in the following pattern:

Both + of + plural pronoun

***Both of us*** are leaving the town. <br>
Did the guards capture ***both of them***?

We may or may not use this pattern when modifying a noun, but it must be used when modifying a plural pronoun.

### Both as an Adjective

As an adjective/determiner, ‘both’ is followed by a noun, but not by a pronoun.

***Both*** children are playing outside. (both – adjective; children - noun)

{{% alert note %}}
‘Both’ can also work as a predeterminer (i.e. it may come before another determiner such as ‘the’, ‘this’, ‘his’ etc)

I like ***both*** these paintings. (both used before the determiner ‘these’) <br>
***Both*** her brothers are criminals. (both used before the determiner ‘her’)
{{% /alert %}}


### Both as a Conjunction

As a conjunction, 'both’ is always used with 'and’. They are examples of correlative conjunctions, just as “either...or” and “not only...but also”. 

In the examples below, “both...and” is used as a conjunction relating two nouns, two adjectives, and two verbs, respectively.

***Both*** Mragank ***and*** Aanya B will come to the party. (joining two nouns - Mragank, Aanya) <br>
The flight was ***both*** late ***and*** turbulent. (joining two adjectives - late, turbulent) <br>
He ***both*** killed ***and*** roasted the poor chicken. (joining two verbs - killed, roasted)

<!-- #### Both and ‘the same’

As a conjunction, 'both...and’ implies that the two people/entities being discussed are equal. So, we need not use the phrase ‘the same’, if we are already using ‘both...and’. Use either ‘both...and’ or ‘the same’ in a sentence to make it concise.

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Both</span>*** student A ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">and</span>*** student B got ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">the same</span>*** marks. (incorrect; as redundancy is there) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Both</span>*** student A ***<span class="mak-text-color">and</span>*** student B got the 20 marks. (correct) <br>
Student A and student B got ***<span class="mak-text-color">the same</span>*** marks. (correct)

When ‘both’ is used as a pronoun, we can use ‘the same’ with it. 

***Both*** students got ***the same*** marks. (correct)

## Uses of Both

We often use 'both' in following patterns:

### Use 1

Pattern 1: Both + (the, my, your, etc.) + plural countable noun

### Use 2

Pattern 2: Both + these, those + plural countable noun

***Both these kids*** need extra care. (kids - plural countable noun)

{{% alert note %}}

{{% alert note %}}
When a determiner (the, my, your, these, those) is used after ‘both’, we can use either ‘both’ or ‘both of’.
{{% /alert %}}

### Use 3

We do not use ’both’ in negative sentences, as it makes the sentence ambiguous. We rather use ’neither’ or ‘either’. 

***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Both of</span>*** my children do not want to study today. (incorrect, as meaning is ambiguous – one child out of the two do not want to study, or two children do not want to study?) <br>
***<span class="mak-text-color">Neither of</span>*** my two children want to study today. (correct; it means two children do not want to study).

There is ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">not</span>*** a major difference in percentages for ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">both</span>*** students, when it comes to science. (incorrect) <br>
There is ***<span class="mak-text-color">not</span>*** a major difference in percentages for ***<span class="mak-text-color">either</span>*** student, when it comes to science. (correct)
