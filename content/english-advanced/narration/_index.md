## What is direct and indirect speech?

Narration – It is a way to narrate a statement.

We can narrate a statement in two ways: 

* Direct Narration/Direct Speech: We write the sentence spoken by the speaker as it is (i.e. without modifying it a bit) <br>
Aanya says, “you study too hard.”

* Indirect Narration/Indirect Speech/Reported Speech: We write the sentence spoken by the speaker in our own words (i.e. we modify the sentence, but without changing the meaning). <br>
Aanya says that I study too hard.

In Direct Speech, we use inverted commas to mark off the exact words of the speaker. In Indirect Speech we do not. 

## Analysis of direct speech

### Components of direct speech

Direct narration has two components:

* Reporting clause – who reports
* Reported speech (quotation) – that which is reported. It can be an assertive, interrogative, imperative, optative, or an exclamatory sentence.

He said to me, “Aanya writes a letter every day".

In the above sentence, the Reporting clause is - He said to me <br>
(said - reporting verb; He - subject of reporting verb; me - object of reporting verb)

Similarly, the Reported speech is - Aanya writes a letter everyday. <br>
(writes - verb of reported speech; Aanya - subject of reported speech; letter - object of reported speech)

### Position of reporting clause 

It’s not necessary for the reporting clause to come at the start. It can come before, within, or at the end of the quotation.

Let us see some examples:

He asked, “Where should I go now?” (reporting clause before the quotation) <br>
“I guess you already know the news,” he said. (reporting clause at the end of the quotation)

“Sure,” Mark replied, “I will get this job done.” (reporting clause within the quotation)

In stories and novels, you will often see that the reporting verb (e.g. say, reply, ask) is placed before the subject when the reporting clause comes after the quotation.

“Why do you want to join our organization?” asked the Manager. <br>
(or The Manager asked, “Why do you want to join our organization”.)

However, we don't use this order when the subject is a pronoun.

“That’s why we decided to relocate”, ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">said she</span>***. (incorrect) <br>
“That’s why we decided to relocate”, ***<span class="mak-text-color">she said</span>***. (correct)
{{% /alert %}}


## Analysis of indirect speech

### Components of indirect speech

Just like direct speech, indirect speech sentences also have a reporting clause and a reported clause.

She told (that) she couldn’t come to the party.

## Which tense to use while reporting?

To report something said or thought in the past → the verb in the reporting clause and reported clause is often in a past tense

Just before boarding, he ***revealed*** that he ***had forgot*** his passport at home. (revealed – verb in reporting clause; had forgot – verb in reported clause)

I ***explained*** that my website ***was*** not made using Wordpress CMS. (explained – verb in reporting clause; was – verb in reported clause)

Mragank ***announced*** that he ***was*** leaving. (announced – verb in reporting clause; was – verb in reported clause)

However, to report current news, opinions, etc. we can use a present tense for the verb in the reporting clause. 

In some cases, either a present tense or past tense is possible. <br>
The mentor ***says/said*** that about 3 students need extra classes in Maths. 

We prefer a present tense (rather than a past tense) in following cases: <br>
* to report information that we have heard, but don't know whether it is true or not.
* to report a general statement about what people say or think.
* to report something said by some authority. 

Alice ***tells me*** that you're moving back with your ex-husband. (we heard something, but don’t know whether it’s true) <br>
Everyone ***says*** that the sea-level is rising and islands are submerging. (general statement about what people say) <br>
The law ***states*** that you cannot drive unless you have a driving license. (reporting something said by some authority)


## Negatives in reporting

lf we want to report a negative sentence, then we normally report this in the ‘reported clause’.

Negative sentence to be reported: 'You are right, she isn't a good dancer.' <br>
Reported speech: He agreed that she ***wasn't*** a good dancer. 

However, with some verbs, to report a negative sentence we make the verb in the ‘reporting clause’ negative, i.e. we make the reporting verb negative (instead of making the verb in ‘reported clause’ negative)

Verbs like this include: say, think, believe, expect, feel, intend, plan, propose, suppose, want. 

Negative sentence to be reported: 'I am sure it's ***not*** acidic.' <br>
She thought it ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">wasn't</span>*** acidic. (incorrect) <br>
She ***<span class="mak-text-color">didn't</span>*** think it was acidic. (correct)

He ***didn't*** tell me how he would get to London.
