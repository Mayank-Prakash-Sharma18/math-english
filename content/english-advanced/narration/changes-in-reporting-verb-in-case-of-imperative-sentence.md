We make any change in the reporting verb and in the sentence structure of direct speech depending on the kind of sentence used under inverted commas.

There may be five kinds of sentences in the inverted commas:

* Assertive
* Interrogative
* Imperative
* Exclamatory
* Optative

In this article, we will cover the transformation in case of Imperative sentences.
