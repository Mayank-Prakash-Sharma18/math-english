We make any change in the reporting verb and in the sentence structure of direct speech depending on the kind of sentence used under inverted commas.

There may be five kinds of sentences in the inverted commas:

* Assertive
* Interrogative
* Imperative
* Exclamatory
* Optative

In this article, we will cover the transformation in case of Exclamatory and Optative sentences. 

## Changing the Reporting verb in Exclamatory sentences

### Concept 1

{{% alert note %}}
If the exclamatory sentence is inside the inverted commas in direct speech, then while converting it into indirect speech we remove the exclamatory expressions and interjections (e.g. how, what, hurray, aha, alas, oh, shit, oops, wow, hush, hmm, etc.)

In these sentences, conjunction 'that' will replace comma and inverted commas. 
{{% /alert %}}

### Concept 2

Said + Hurray! / Wow! changes to exclaimed with joy. <br>
Said + Alas! changes to exclaimed with sorrow.

He said, " Hurray! I have won". <br>
He ***exclaimed with joy*** that he had won.

He said, “Alas! I am bankrupt". <br>
He ***exclaimed with sorrow*** that he was bankrupt.

Instead of ‘exclaimed with sorrow’, we can also use ‘exclaimed sadly’. 

He said, “Alas! I am broke.” <br>
He ***exclaimed sadly*** that he was broke.
