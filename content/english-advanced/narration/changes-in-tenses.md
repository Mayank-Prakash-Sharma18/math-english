## Reporting verb in Present tense or Future tense

If the reporting verb (or principal verb) is in the present tense or the future tense, then we do not change the tense of the direct speech/reported speech. 

She says, “Mak was a teacher". <br>
She says that Mak was a teacher. (Mak was a teacher -  reported speech, no change in tense)

He will say, “I am not the culprit". <br>
He will say that he is not the culprit. (he is not the culprit - reported speech, no change in tense)


## Reporting verb in Past tense

When the reporting verb is in the past tense (and the reported speech is not an idiom/phrase etc.), all tenses of the direct/reported speech are changed into the corresponding past tenses. That is:

* Case 1: Simple present ($V_1$/do/does) is changed to Simple past ($V_2$/did).
* Case 2: Simple past ($V_2$/did) is changed to Past perfect (had + $V_3$).
* Case 3: Past perfect (had + $V_3$) is not changed.

### Exceptions to general rules

#### Exception 1

Tenses in case of permanent situation or universal truth:

If the reporting verb is in 'past', and the reported speech is still relevant (i.e. a universal truth/phrase/idiom/habitual action/historical fact). 

In such a case, we can often choose whether to keep the original tenses or change them. 

<img src="../../../media/narration/narration-4.png" alt="Direct and Indirect speech" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

If the reporting verb is in the past tense, we prefer past tense (over present tense) in the reported clause in the following cases:

* we are not sure that what we are reporting is necessarily true
* a situation may not still exist now
* when we are reporting objectively

Compare the following sentences:

Jim told me that he ***has*** three cars. (told – reporting verb in past tense; has – verb in the reported clause in present tense; it suggests that what is being reported is indeed true, i.e. Jim do have three cars.)

Jim told me that he ***had*** three cars. (told – reporting verb in past tense; had – verb in the reported clause in past tense; it suggests that what is being reported is either not true, or that situation no more exits, i.e. either Jim never had three cars, or he once had three cars, but not now.)

<!-- {{% alert note %}}
If the reporting verb is in ‘present’, and we are reporting a permanent situation or universal truth, then we also use a present tense for the verb in the reported clause. 

Aanya ***thinks*** that she ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">spent</span>*** about 15 minutes on a typical meeting with a customer. (incorrect) <br>
Aanya ***thinks*** that she ***<span class="mak-text-color">spends</span>*** about 15 minutes on a typical meeting with a customer. (correct; thinks – reporting verb in present tense; spends – verb in reported clause in present tense too)

British scientists ***claim*** that they ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">developed</span>*** a new vaccine for Covid-19. (incorrect) <br>
British scientists ***claim*** that they ***<span class="mak-text-color">have developed</span>*** a new vaccine for Covid-19. (correct; claim – reporting verb in present tense; have developed – verb in reported clause in present tense too)
