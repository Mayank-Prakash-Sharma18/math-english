To keep the meaning intact, we make some major changes while changing from direct speech to indirect speech. 

Let’s see them!

## Conversion from direct speech to indirect speech

We consider the following points for conversion:

* insertion of conjunction
* change of person
* change of tense
* change in the reporting verb
* change in the expression of time or place
* removal of unnecessary things like hello, wow, etc (i.e. those expressions which we generally only use when talking to someone face to face, i.e. in spoken English)

We will study some of the above points in this article. But some of the above require a separate article, e.g. change in tenses, change in the reporting verb. We will cover them in subsequent articles. 

## Insertion of Conjunction

While changing a sentence into indirect speech, ‘comma' and 'inverted commas' are removed and instead some conjunction (e.g. 'that’) is used.

The conjunction in indirect speech combines reporting clause with reported speech.

Sometimes the conjunction ‘that’ is silent. 
{{% /alert %}}

The conjunction we will use in indirect speech will depend on the kind of sentence in the reported clause of direct speech.

## Change in Person/Pronoun

When we change direct speech into indirect speech, we change the pronouns, where necessary.

<!-- While doing so we make sure that in indirect speech the relations between the reporter and his hearer are indicated (rather than the reporter and the original speaker).  -->

<img src="../../../media/narration/narration-5.png" alt="Direct and Indirect speech" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

Pronouns are changed according to the following rules:

* $1^{st}$ Person (I, we) changes according to Subject of reporting verb.
* $2^{nd}$ Person (you) changes according to Object of reporting verb.
* $3^{rd}$ Person (he, she, it, they) does not change.

{{% alert note %}}
You can remember it using the acronym: S ($1^{st}$) O ($2^{nd}$) N ($3^{rd}$)

* S - Subject of reporting verb
* O - Object of reporting verb
* N - No change
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert note %}}
The case of the pronoun shouldn’t be changed. E.g. we can change ‘I’ (subjective case) to ‘he’ (subjective case), but not to ‘him’ (objective case).

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- Apart from these general rules, there are a few exceptions and extra rules that we need to keep in mind.

### Exceptions

#### Exception 1

If the subject of reporting verb is 'he' or 'she', and  'we' is used inside the inverted commas, then  in normal case we convert 'we' into 'they'. However, if the person reporting that statement (i.e. speaker) is also included in that statement,  then we do not change ‘we’, i.e. we leave it as it is.

Direct Speech: She said to me, "***we*** are friends".

In normal case  we will convert ‘we’ into ‘they’, as per the subject of the reporting verb. <br>
Indirect Speech: She said to me that ***they*** are friends. 

However,  if the person reporting is also a friend of her, then we leave it as it is. <br>
Indirect Speech: She said to me that ***we*** are friends. 

Sometimes, there is no ambiguity on whether the speaker is also included in the statement or not. <br>
Direct Speech: My brother said to me, “***we*** can’t change the habit of our father.” <br>
Indirect Speech: My brother told me that ***we*** could not change the habit of our father.

#### Exception 2

We change 'we' into 'it' in case of newspaper, organisation, etc. 

The New York Times said, “***we*** are not responsible for this kind of error.” <br>
The New York Times said that ***it*** was not responsible for that kind of error.   -->

## Change in Time and Place

If Reporting verb is in present tense – Then no change is made in the words relating to time & place 

If Reporting verb is in past tense – Then the words relating to time and place are changed. 

Words expressing nearness in time or place are generally changed into words expressing distance.

## Change of Modals

There’s no change in the following modals:

should, would, could, might, ought to, used to

'I ***could*** meet you at the bar.' <br>
He said that he ***could*** meet us at the bar.

'We ***might*** go fishing if we have spare time.' <br>
They said they ***might*** go fishing if they have spare time.

While changing Direct Speech into Indirect Speech, we make the following changes:

### may, can

* may – might
* can – could

She said, "I ***cannot*** help you at this time.“ <br>
She said that she ***couldn't*** help me at that time.

### will

will (with second and third person)  →  would/should 

‘would’ can come with first, second or third person. <br>
‘should’ is preferred only with first person.

{{% alert note %}}
#### Exceptions

So, we know that ‘will’ usually changes to ‘would’, ‘can’ to ‘could’, and ‘may’ to ‘might’. However, there are a few exceptions:

##### Exception 1

If verb in the reporting clause is in a present tense and the situation we are reporting still exists or is still in the future → We prefer will, can, and may in the indirect speech. 

'Careful! You ***will*** burn your hands!' <br>
I warned him he ***would*** burn his hands. (the situation no longer exists, so we used ‘would’)

'I ***will*** be in Mewad at Deepawali.' <br>
He ***tells*** me he ***will*** be in Mewad at Deepawali. (tells – present tense; the situation still exists or is in the future, so we used ‘will’)

##### Exception 2

If verb in the reporting clause is in a past tense and the situation we are reporting still exists or is still in the future → We can use either would or will, can or could, and may or might in the indirect speech.

'The situation can be resolved.' <br>
They ***said*** the situation ***can/could*** be resolved. (said – past tense)
{{% /alert %}}

### shall

shall (comes with I/we)  →  would/should 

‘would’ can come with first, second or third person. <br>
‘should’ is preferred only with first person.

He said to me, "I shall come to meet you tomorrow." <br>
He told me that he would come to meet me the next day.

{{% alert note %}}
shall (request) → should (request) <br>
‘should’ comes with all persons if it is a request.
{{% /alert %}}

### must

#### Concept 1

If in direct speech, 'must' has been used to say that it is necessary to do something → We can use either ‘must’ or ‘had to’ in the indirect speech ('had to' is preferred)

'You ***must*** be home by 8 o'clock.' <br>
He said I ***must / had to*** be home by 8 o'clock.

#### Concept 2

If in direct speech, 'must' has been used to conclude that something (has) happened or say that something is true (i.e. when we draw conclusions) → We use ‘must’ (rather than ‘had to’) in the indirect speech 

'I ***must*** be getting old.' <br>
He said that he ***must*** be getting old.

### mustn’t

If in direct speech, mustn't has been used → We use ‘mustn't’ in the indirect speech (rather than didn't have to)

'You ***mustn't*** kill John Connor.' <br>
He warned me that I ***mustn't*** kill John Connor.

{{% alert note %}}
We sometimes use a modal verb in indirect speech, even though there was no modal verb in the direct speech.

'You're not allowed to play here.' <br>
He told me that I ***mustn't*** play there.
{{% /alert %}}

<!-- ## Miscellaneous

Words of respect in the direct speech ('Sir, 'Madam‘, 'Your Honour' etc.) are changed to ‘respectfully' in the indirect speech.

Words of affection in the direct speech ('Darling‘, 'Dear‘, 'My beloved' etc.) are changed to ‘lovingly/affectionately' in the indirect speech. -->


## Conversion of Indirect into Direct 

The conversion of indirect speech into direct speech is pretty easy and generally presents no special difficulties.

Indirect speech: As the salesman entered the society, he was met by a watchman, who asked him if he was a delivery boy. <br>
Direct speech: As the salesman entered the society, he was met by a watchman, who asked, “Are you a delivery boy?”

Indirect speech: He asked how he could be of any help. <br>
Direct speech: He said, “How can I be of any help?
