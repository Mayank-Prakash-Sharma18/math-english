Some of the important points to keep in mind while transforming active into passive voice or vice-versa.

## Subject – Object Change

When a verb is changed from active voice to passive voice, the object of the transitive verb in the active voice becomes the subject of the verb in the passive voice.

We cannot make passive voice of sentences having no object (e.g. in case of intransitive verbs). Thus only transitive verbs can be used in the passive voice.

Keep in mind most of the verbs can function both as transitive and intransitive. You will have to look at a particular sentence to find out how they are working.

### Multiple objects

Verbs that can be followed by either ***indirect object + direct object*** or ***direct object + prepositional object*** in active clauses can have two corresponding passive forms. When they are changed to the passive, either object may become the subject of the passive verb, while the other is retained. 

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice1.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

An indirect object usually denotes the person to whom or for whom something is given or done, while a direct object usually denotes a thing. The passive form we choose depends on which one is more appropriate in a particular context. But, it is more usual for passive constructions to begin with the person, i.e. indirect object.

Let’s see some more examples:

Some verbs can’t be followed by two objects. They are always followed by a single object in the active voice. So, such verbs can have only one passive form.

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice3.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

Other verbs like this are: give, lend, offer, promise, sell, teach, tell, throw.

### Verb + Preposition + Object

Some sentences have no direct or indirect objects but only prepositional objects. 

Active voice: Verb + Preposition + Object

In case of verb with prepositional object, we follow the required rules and keep the preposition with the verb. 

Examples:

We should never look down upon the poor. <br>
The poor should never be looked down upon by us. 

Everyone has to comply with these rules. <br>
These rules have to be complied with by everyone.


### Verb + Object + Objective Complement

Active voice: Subject + (Helping verb) + elect/appoint/call + ..... + Object + Objective complement 

Passive voice: Passive Subject + (Helping verb) + be + elected/appointed/called + .... + Objective complement + Preposition + Doer

Examples:

I ***call*** my dog tiger. (active voice)   (I – subject; call – verb; my – determiner; dog – object; tiger – object complement) <br>
My dog ***is called*** tiger by me. (passive voice) (dog  - receiver in subjective case; me – doer in objective case)

Selectors ***have elected*** Mr. A.B. de Villiers captain of the South African cricket team. (active voice) <br>
Mr. A.B. de Villiers ***has been elected*** captain of the South African cricket team by selectors. (passive voice)

### Subject vague/understood

Sometimes, the subject is vague or understood from the rest of the sentence. In such cases, it is possible to drop  by + object  in passive voice, as the meaning is clear even without it. 

### Concept 1

Certain actions are done by a particular subject only, e.g. Doctor, Police etc. In such cases ‘by object' must not be mentioned in the passive voice. 

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice4.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

### Concept 2

Sometimes, the subject is not clear (vague noun / indefinite pronoun), e.g. people, they, one, everyone etc. In such cases ‘by object’ need not be mentioned in the passive voice. 

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice5.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

### Concept 3

Sometimes, we are given a sentence in passive voice without ‘by object’ (i.e. without the doer). In such cases, we are supposed to use that subject in active voice that generally does that work (because in active voice subject is necessary).

## Change in Verb form

To form the passive voice, we use: a suitable tense of the verb 'be' followed by the past participle. 

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice7.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice8.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

<!-- <img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice9.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> -->

You may have noticed that while converting active voice to passive voice, apart from using be + $V_3$:

* we also add ‘being’ in case of continuous aspect, $V_4$ (i.e. in present continuous and past continuous tenses)
* we also add ‘been’ in cases of perfect aspect, $V_3$ (i.e. in present perfect, past perfect and future perfect tenses)

The same is true when we convert Modal + $V_1$  into passive. 

{{% alert note %}}
If any form of 'be' is used as main verb, then that sentence cannot be turned into passive voice.

For example, have a look at the following active voice sentences:

I ***am*** rich. (am – main verb)

She should ***be*** grateful. (be – main verb)

### two- and three-word verbs

Some verbs in active voice are also followed by adverbs and prepositions, e.g. phrasal verbs.

We must not forget to use these adverbs and prepositions in passive voice.

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice10.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

### Verbs bid, help and make

Verbs bid, help and make:

* in active voice are followed by a bare infinitive ($V_1$), and 
* in passive voice are followed by a to-infinitive (to + $V_1$)

Active voice: Subject + Helping verb+ make/bid/help + Object + $V_1$ + ... <br>
Passive voice: Passive subject+ Helping verb + be/made/bidden + to + $V_1$ + Preposition + Doer

Compare:

Active voice: I bade her ***leave*** the room. (leave – bare infinitive) <br> 
Passive voice: She was bidden ***to leave*** the room by me. (to leave – to-infinitive)

Active voice: They must help us ***win***. (win – bare infinitive) <br> 
Passive voice: We must be helped by them ***to win***. (to win – to-infinitive)

Active voice: I made him ***clean*** all the dishes. (clean – bare infinitive) <br> 
Passive voice: He was made ***to clean*** all the dishes by me. (to clean – to-infinitive)

## Tenses

### Active patterns with Verb + ing (i.e. Continuous Tenses) 

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice11.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

{{% alert note %}}
We always use 'being' in passive voice of continuous tenses.

***A Miscellaneous concept***

Active voice: Subject + need/want/require + $V_4$ <br>
Passive voice: Subject + need/want/require + to be + $V_3$   

Your hair needs cutting. <br>
Your hair needs to be cut.

### Active patterns with Perfect Tenses 

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice13.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

{{% alert note %}}
We always use ‘been' in passive voice of perfect tenses. 
{{% /alert %}}

Examples:

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice14.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">


## Active patterns with Verb + to-infinitive 

In such sentences there are essentially two verbs – the main verb and the verb in the infinitive (to + $V_1$).

The infinitive can have two positions:

* Verb + to-infinitive + Object
* Verb + Object + to-infinitive

Let us consider them both one by one.

### Case 1: Verb + to-infinitive + Object

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice15.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

So, basically this is how the infinitive verb changes its form: <br>
Active: To + $V_1$ (to respect) <br> 
Passive: 	To + be + $V_3$ (to be respected)

But the main verb may or may not change its form.

Verbs that follow this pattern are of two kinds: 

* Those verbs which have corresponding meanings in active and passive sentences. <br>
For example: appear, begin, come, continue, do, has/have/had, seem, start, tend, write. 

* Those verbs which do not have corresponding meanings in active and passive sentences. <br>
For example: agree, aim, attempt, hope, refuse, struggle, try 

Compare:

People ***came to recognise*** him as a brave soldier. (active voice) <br>
He ***came to be recognised*** as a brave soldier. (passive voice; active and passive voice sentences give out the same meaning)

Saurav Ganguly ***hoped to select*** Jadeja. (active voice) <br> 
Jadeja ***hoped to be selected*** by Saurav Ganguly. (passive voice; active and passive voice sentences have different meanings.)

### Case 2: Verb + Object + to-infinitive

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice16.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

So, the infinitive verb may or may not change its form: <br>
Active: To + $V_1$ <br>
Passive: 	To + $V_1$  OR To + be + $V_3$

But the main verb does change its form.

The Verbs that follow this pattern are: <br>
advise, allow, ask, believe, consider, expect, feel, instruct, mean, order, report, require, teach, tell, understand.

{{% alert note %}}
Some verbs followed by an ‘object + to-infinitive’ in the active have no passive: <br>
Active voice: Mayank ***liked*** Aanya ***to be*** there. <br>
Passive voice: <s>Aanya was liked to be there by Mayank</s>. (not possible)

Verbs that fall in this category are: (can't) bear, hate, like, love, need, prefer, want, wish.
