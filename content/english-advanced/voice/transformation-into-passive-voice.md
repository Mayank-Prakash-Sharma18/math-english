Here are some of the important points to keep in mind while transforming active into passive voice or vice-versa: 

S - Subject <br>
O – Object <br>
P – Preposition <br>
T – Tense <br>
V - Verb <br>
$M_3$ - Meaning, Mood, Mode <br>
P – Placement

We studied in the last article that when a verb is changed from active voice to passive voice, the object of the transitive verb in the active voice becomes the subject of the verb in the passive voice.

Active Voice Pattern: Subject + Verb + Object

India helps Bhutan. (Indian – subject; helps – verb; Bhutan - object)

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice17.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

Passive Voice Pattern: Subject (passive) + Helping verb ‘be’ (according to Tense) + $V_3$ + by + Object

Bhutan is helped by India. (Bhutan – passive subject; is – helping verb; helped – $V_3$; India – object of preposition ‘by’)

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice18.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

But what about the Verb? How does the verb form and tense form change? 

Let's see. 


## Change in Verb form

To form the passive voice, we use a suitable tense of the verb 'be' followed by the past participle (be + $V_3$). 
<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice7.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

{{% alert note %}}
The passive voice for the following tenses is extremely rare:
* Present Perfect Continuous: has/have been (Active Voice) → has/have been being (Passive Voice)
* Past Perfect Continuous: had been (Active Voice) → had been being (Passive Voice)
* Future Continuous: will be (Active Voice) → will be being (Passive Voice)
* Future Perfect Continuous: will have been (Active Voice) → will have been being (Passive Voice)
{{% /alert %}}

You may have noticed that while converting active voice to passive voice, apart from using be + $V_3$:

* we also add ‘being’ in case of continuous aspect, $V_4$ (i.e. in present continuous and past continuous tenses). That is, for sentences having V+ing verb form in the active voice, we must have 'being' in the passive voice. 
* we also add ‘been’ in cases of perfect aspect, has/have/had + $V_3$ (i.e. in present perfect, past perfect and future perfect tenses). That is, for sentences having has/have/had in the active voice, we must have 'been' in the passive voice (such sentences use $V_3$ in both active and passive voice). 

The same is true when we convert Modal + $V_1$  into passive. 

In case of modals, we use the following patterns: <br>
Pattern 1: modal + $V_1$ → modal + be + $V_3$ <br>
Pattern 2: modal + have + $V_3$ → modal + have + been + $V_3$
<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice8.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

{{% alert note %}}
We use Pattern 1: modal + $V_1$ → modal + be + $V_3$, in case of following modals: <br>
can, could, shall, should, would, must, may, might. <br>
Also, has to, have to, had to, used to, may have to, might have to, will have to, would like to. 

We use Pattern 2: modal + have + $V_3$ → modal + have + been + $V_3$, in case of following modals: <br>
could have, should have, would have, must have, may have, might have.

If any form of 'be' is used as the main verb, then that sentence cannot be turned into passive voice.

For example, have a look at the following active voice sentences:

I ***am*** rich. (am – main verb)

She should ***be*** grateful. (be – main verb)
{{% /alert %}} -->

### two- and three-word verbs

Some verbs in active voice are also followed by adverbs and prepositions, e.g. phrasal verbs.

We must not forget to use these adverbs and prepositions in passive voice.

<!-- ### Passive Voice with Infinitives and Gerunds

Apart from modals, there are some other verbs that are followed by Infinitives. With them we use Infinitive Passive Voice. 

He ***has to be tested*** on his Maths skills. <br>
He ***wants to be invited*** to the Thanksgiving dinner.

There are some verbs and prepositions that are followed by Gerunds. With them we use Gerund Passive Voice.

I ***remember being taught*** to swim. <br>
The kids are excited ***about being taken*** to the museum.

{{% alert note %}}
We can also rewrite the above sentence as:

The kids are excited ***to be taken*** to the museum.

<!-- ### Verbs bid, help and make

Verbs bid, help and make:

* in active voice are followed by a bare infinitive ($V_1$), and 
* in passive voice are followed by a to-infinitive (to + $V_1$)

Active voice: Subject + Helping verb+ make/bid/help + Object + $V_1$ + ... <br>
Passive voice: Passive subject+ Helping verb + be/made/bidden + to + $V_1$ + Preposition + Doer

Compare:

Active voice: I bade her ***leave*** the room. (leave – bare infinitive) <br> 
Passive voice: She was bidden ***to leave*** the room by me. (to leave – to-infinitive)

Active voice: They must help us ***win***. (win – bare infinitive) <br> 
Passive voice: We must be helped by them ***to win***. (to win – to-infinitive)

Active voice: I made him ***clean*** all the dishes. (clean – bare infinitive) <br> 
Passive voice: He was made ***to clean*** all the dishes by me. (to clean – to-infinitive) -->

## Change Tense Form

Now, let's study the transformation of some verb forms in more detail - when the tenses (or aspects of tenses) involved are:
* Continuous
* Perfect

### Active-Passive patterns with Continuous Tenses 

The following table showcases the Active Voice and Passive Voice patterns, when it comes to Continuous Tenses (Verb + ing).
<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice11.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

{{% alert note %}}
We always use 'being' in passive voice of continuous tenses.

***A Miscellaneous concept***

Active voice: Subject + need/want/require + $V_4$ <br>
Passive voice: Subject + need/want/require + to be + $V_3$

## Subject – Object Change

When a verb is changed from active voice to passive voice, the object of the transitive verb in the active voice becomes the subject of the verb in the passive voice.

We cannot make passive voice of sentences having no object (e.g. in case of intransitive verbs). Thus, ***only transitive verbs can be used in the passive voice***. 

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

{{% alert note %}}
Keep in mind most of the verbs can function both as transitive and intransitive. You will have to look at a particular sentence to find out how they are working.
{{% /alert %}}

### Multiple objects

Verbs that can be followed by either ***indirect object + direct object*** or ***direct object + prepositional object*** in active clauses can have two corresponding passive forms. When they are changed to the passive, either object may become the subject of the passive verb, while the other is retained. 

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice1.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

An indirect object usually denotes the person to whom or for whom something is given or done, while a direct object usually denotes a thing. The passive form we choose depends on which one is more appropriate in a particular context. But it is more usual for passive constructions to begin with the person, i.e. indirect object.

Let’s see some more examples:

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice2.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

{{% alert note %}}
Some verbs can’t be followed by two objects. They are always followed by a single object in the active voice. So, such verbs can have only one passive form.

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice3.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

Other verbs like this are: give, lend, offer, promise, sell, teach, tell, throw. 
{{% /alert %}}

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- ### Verb + Preposition + Object

Some sentences have no direct or indirect objects but only prepositional objects. 

Active voice: Verb + Preposition + Object

In case of verb with prepositional object, we follow the required rules and ***keep the preposition with the verb***. 

Examples:

We should never ***look*** down upon the poor. ('the poor' is the object of the preposition 'upon'; look - verb) <br>
The poor should never ***be looked*** down upon by us. 

Everyone has to ***comply*** with these rules. ('these rules' is the object of the preposition 'with'; comply - verb) <br>
These rules have to ***be complied*** with by everyone.


### Verb + Object + Objective Complement

Active voice: Subject + (Helping verb) + elect/appoint/call + ..... + Object + Objective complement 

Passive voice: Passive Subject + (Helping verb) + be + elected/appointed/called + .... + Objective complement + Preposition + Doer

Examples:

I ***call*** my dog tiger. (active voice)   (I – subject; call – verb; my – determiner; dog – object; tiger – object complement) <br>
My dog ***is called*** tiger by me. (passive voice) (dog  - receiver in subjective case; me – doer in objective case)

Selectors ***have elected*** Mr. A.B. de Villiers captain of the South African cricket team. (active voice) <br>
Mr. A.B. de Villiers ***has been elected*** captain of the South African cricket team by selectors. (passive voice) -->

### Subject vague/understood

Sometimes, the subject is vague or understood from the rest of the sentence. In such cases, it is possible to drop  by + object  in passive voice, as the meaning is clear even without it. 

#### Concept 1

Certain actions are done by a particular subject only, e.g. Doctor, Police etc. In such cases ‘by object' must not be mentioned in the passive voice. 

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice4.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

#### Concept 2

Sometimes, the subject is not clear (vague noun / indefinite pronoun), e.g. people, they, one, everyone etc. In such cases ‘by object’ need not be mentioned in the passive voice. 

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice5.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- #### Concept 3

Sometimes, we are given a sentence in passive voice without ‘by object’ (i.e. without the doer). In such cases, we are supposed to use that subject in active voice that generally does that work (because in active voice subject is necessary). 

<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice6.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> -->

## Active-Passive patterns with Verb + to-infinitive 

In such sentences there are essentially two verbs – the main verb and the verb in the infinitive (to + $V_1$).

The infinitive can have two positions:

* Verb + to-infinitive + Object
* Verb + Object + to-infinitive

Let us consider them both one by one.

### Case 1: Verb + to-infinitive + Object

Consider the following patterns and examples:
<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice15.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

It's evident from above, that this is how the infinitive verb changes its form: <br>
Active: To + $V_1$ (to respect) <br> 
Passive: 	To + be + $V_3$ (to be respected)

But the main verb may or may not change its form.

Verbs that follow this pattern are of two kinds: 

* Those verbs which have corresponding meanings in active and passive sentences. <br>
For example: appear, begin, come, continue, do, has/have/had, seem, start, tend, write. 

* Those verbs which do not have corresponding meanings in active and passive sentences. <br>
For example: agree, aim, attempt, hope, refuse, struggle, try 

Compare:

People ***came to recognise*** him as a brave soldier. (active voice) <br>
He ***came to be recognised*** as a brave soldier. (passive voice; active and passive voice sentences give out the same meaning)

Saurav Ganguly ***hoped to select*** Jadeja. (active voice) <br> 
Jadeja ***hoped to be selected*** by Saurav Ganguly. (passive voice; active and passive voice sentences have different meanings.)

### Case 2: Verb + Object + to-infinitive

Consider the following patterns and examples:
<img src="../../../media/voice/active-passive-voice16.png" alt="transformation to passive voice" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

It's evident, that the infinitive verb may or may not change its form: <br>
Active: To + $V_1$ <br>
Passive: 	To + $V_1$  OR To + be + $V_3$

But the main verb does change its form.

The Verbs that follow this pattern are: <br>
advise, allow, ask, believe, consider, expect, feel, instruct, mean, order, report, require, teach, tell, understand.

{{% alert note %}}
Some verbs followed by an ‘object + to-infinitive’ in the active have no passive: <br>
Active voice: Mayank ***liked*** Aanya ***to be*** there. <br>
Passive voice: <s>Aanya was liked to be there by Mayank</s>. (not possible)

Verbs that fall in this category are: (can't) bear, hate, like, love, need, prefer, want, wish.

    Then comes the verb in $V_3$ form, i.e. we will convert 'do' to 'done'. <br><br>
    The subject 'I' of the active voice will become the object of the preposition 'by'. As it's an object now, it will be in objective case, i.e. 'me'. <br><br>
