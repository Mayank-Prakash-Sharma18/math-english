In this article, we will try to understand when we can or should use passive voice. 

## Use Case 1

When the person doing the action (i.e. doer or agent) is to be made prominent, then we use the active voice. <br>
When the person or thing acted upon (i.e. receiver) is to be made prominent, then we use the passive voice. 

Active voice: We will execute all orders promptly. (focus on ‘we’) <br>
Passive voice: All orders will be executed promptly.  (focus on ‘all orders’)

Generally, when active voice involves the use of an indefinite or vague pronoun or noun (somebody, they, people, we, etc.) as subject, then we rather prefer the passive voice. For example: 

* when we do not know the agent. <br> 
My apartment ***was broken into*** when I was on holiday. (unknown agent)

* when it is pretty obvious who the agent is. <br> 
He ***is being treated*** in nursing home. (obvious agent - 'doctors')

* when we do not care to name the agent (i.e. agent is 'people in general’, or is unimportant). <br>
Savings account form ***can be found*** on the counter. (agent - people in general) <br>
This piece of equipment ***should be handled*** with care. (unimportant agent)

## Use Case 2

In an active voice sentence - we need to include the agent as subject <br>
In a passive voice sentence - we can omit the agent by leaving out the ‘by’ prepositional phrase, if it is evident who the agent (i.e., doer of the action) is.

This helps us construct cleaner sentences.  

Active voice - The spectators loudly cheered Messi’s goal. <br>
Passive voice - Messi’s goal was loudly cheered. (by the spectators - omitted)

Active voice - Someone has invited her to the wedding. <br>
Passive voice - She has been invited to the wedding. (by someone - omitted)

We cannot omit the by-phrase if the agent has some importance and is necessary to complete the sense of the sentence.

## Use Case 3

Passive Voice is also used when the subject is incapable of doing an action.

Coffee grows both in India and South America. (incorrect) <br>
Coffee is grown both in India and South America. (correct)

## Use Case 4

We may also choose a passive rather than an active in following cases:

* In factual writing (e.g. when we describe procedures or processes), we often omit the agent, and use passives: <br>
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant will still be a radioactive hazard even after 100 years, until and unless the nuclear waste ***is disposed*** of. It ***can be stored*** in stainless-steel containers which ***are encased*** in concrete. 

* Passive structure sometimes allows us to link two sentences better. <br>
Many customers are complaining about the quality of the new fabric. The Aanya Textiles in Australia manufactured the fabric. (Second sentence is in active voice) <br>
Many customers are complaining about the quality of the new fabric. The fabric ***was manufactured*** by the Aanya Textiles in Australia. (Second sentence is in passive voice)

## Use Case 5

It is often more natural and desirable to put long subjects at the end of a sentence, using the passive structure:

Active voice: Abinav’s decision to skip the last attempt in competitive exam surprised me. (kind of hard to read) <br>
Passive voice: I ***was surprised*** by Abinav’s decision to skip the last attempt in competitive exam. (easier to read and sounds more natural)

Natural happenings are always in active voice.

The sun rises in the East. <br>
It rains a lot in North-East India. <br>
It is snowing outside. <br>
The rescue work will gain pace as the flood water recedes. <br>
It seems like the storm is approaching.
