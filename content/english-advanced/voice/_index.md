## What is a Voice?

Voice - form of a Verb which shows whether Subject ***does something*** or ***has something done to it***.

## Types of Voices

### Active Voice

If the form of the verb shows that Subject ***does something*** (subject is the ***doer*** of the action, it is active).

Active Voice Pattern: Subject + Verb + Object

India helps Bhutan. (Indian – subject; helps – verb; Bhutan - object)

### Passive Voice

If the form of the verb shows that ***something is done to*** the Subject (subject receives some action, it is passive).

Passive Voice Pattern: Subject (passive) + Helping verb ‘be’ (according to Tense) + $V_3$ + by + Object

Bhutan is helped by India. (Bhutan – passive subject; is – helping verb; helped – $V_3$; India – object of preposition ‘by’)

So to make Passive voice we use: be + $V_3$

Let’s observe these two sentences again:

Active Voice: India helps Bhutan. (Indian – subject; helps – verb; Bhutan - object) <br>
Passive voice: Bhutan is helped by India. (Bhutan – passive subject; is – helping verb; helped – $V_3$; India – object of preposition ‘by’)

In passive voice, the subject of active voice becomes the object of preposition ‘by’. It is in objective case now and not in subjective case. <br>
(Note that, though in layman’s terms we say that subject in active voice becomes the object in passive voice, but technically it is the object of the preposition ‘by’ and not that of the verb.). 

Similarly, in passive voice, the object of active voice becomes a passive subject. It is in subjective case now and not in objective case. The helping verb in passive voice will agree with the number and person of the passive subject.

In passive voice, the object of preposition ‘by’ is also called as the doer (as it does the action). 

Similarly, in passive voice, the passive subject is also called the receiver (as subject of passive voice is passive, it receives the action).

Receiver is also called as Patient, while Doer is also called as Agent.
{{% /alert %}}

So, we can also write the passive voice pattern as follows:

Passive Voice Pattern: Receiver + Helping verb ‘be’ (according to Tense) + $V_3$ + by + Doer

Bhutan is ***helped*** by India. (Bhutan – passive subject/receiver; is – helping verb; helped – $V_3$; India – object of preposition/doer)

by + object comes for $V_3$,  so it should be kept near $V_3$.

In the middle one or two words can come, but ‘by + object’ should not be very far from $V_3$.

Active voice: He writes a letter here. <br>
Passive voice: A letter is written here by him. 


## Use of Prepositions other than ‘by’

Certain verbs are always followed by a certain preposition, which replaces the 'by' of 'by + object’ in the passive voice (generally with, at, in, of and to).

amazed at, amused at something, angry with somebody, annoyed with somebody, annoyed at something, astonished at, comprised of, contained in, crammed with, cut with something, decorated with, embodied in, engulfed in, filled with, interested in, known to, married to, ornamented with, pleased with somebody,  pleased at something, satisfied with somebody, satisfied at something, startled at, surprised at, thronged with, tired of, vexed at.
 
Active voice: He pleased me. <br>
Passive voice: I was ***pleased with*** him. 

Active voice: The forest fire in California engulfed the whole posh community of Orange county. <br>
Passive voice: The whole posh community of Orange county was ***engulfed in*** the forest fire in California.

Active voice: He knows me. <br>
Passive voice: I am ***known to*** him. 

### Surprised

'Surprised' is followed by 'at' when the action was contrary to our expectation. <br>
All guests in the party were ***surprised at*** his rude behavior.

In all other cases 'surprised by' is used. <br>
Scientists were ***surprised by*** the result of the Young's double slit experiment.

### Instrument

We use with (not by) to talk about an instrument used by the agent. 

Compare:

Active Voice: Somebody hit the cat with a stick. <br>
Passive Voice: The cat was hit ***with a stick***. 

Active Voice: A boy hit the cat. <br>
Passive Voice: The cat was hit ***by a boy***.
