There are three categories of interrogative sentences from active-passive perspective:

* Type 1: interrogative sentence of ‘wh family’ - 'why', 'when', 'where’, 'how' and 'what’

* Type 2: interrogative sentence of ‘wh family’ – ‘who’, ‘whom’ and 'whose'.

* Type 3: interrogative sentence of ‘non-wh family’

{{% alert note %}}
* The Passive voice of Affirmative sentences will be in Affirmative form.
* The Passive voice of Negative sentences will be in Negative form.
* The Passive voice of Interrogative sentences will be in Interrogative form.

## Type 1 'wh family'

### Concept 1

To make passive of an interrogative sentence of ‘wh family’ - 'why', 'when', 'where’, 'how' and 'what’ :

Active voice: Question word + Helping verb + Doer + Main verb + Object + ........? <br>
Passive voice: Question word + Helping verb + Passive subject + (some form of be) + $V_3$ + Preposition + Doer + .......... ? 

Just add the ‘wh' word at the start. 

Active voice: Why ***have*** you ***injured*** this puppy? <br>
Passive voice: Why ***has*** the puppy ***been injured*** by you?

Active voice: How ***can*** he ***love*** you? <br>
Passive voice: How ***can*** you ***be loved*** by him?

### Concept 2

We follow the following structure in case of active voice interrogative sentences that start with Question word + do/does/did:

Active voice: Question word + do/does/did (Helping verb) + Doer + $V_1$ (Main verb) + Noun/Pronoun + ........? <br>
Passive voice: Question word + is/am/are/was/were (Helping verb) + Noun/Pronoun + $V_3$ + Preposition + Doer + .......... ? 

That is, when the helping verb in active voice is do/does/did, we use is/am/are/was/were as helping verb in passive voice (and not do/does/did).

Active voice: Why ***did*** you ***hit*** her? <br>
Passive voice: Why ***was*** she ***hit*** by you?


## Type 2 'wh family'

<!-- ### Concept 1 -->

To make passive of an interrogative sentence of ‘wh family’ – ‘who’, ‘whom’ and ‘whose’, we follow different rules, because in these cases question word is the subject of active voice.

#### In case of 'Who'

In case there is a helping verb in the active voice:

Active voice: Who + Helping verb + Main verb + Noun/Pronoun ........ ? <br>
Passive voice I: Preposition + whom + Helping verb + Noun/Pronoun + (some form of be) + $V_3$ + ........? <br> 
Passive voice II: Who + Helping verb + Noun/Pronoun + (some form of be) + $V_3$ + Preposition + ................... ? 

Active voice: Who ***has beaten*** you? <br>
Passive voice I: By whom ***have*** you ***been beaten***? <br>
Passive voice II: Who ***have*** you ***been beaten*** by?

In case there is no helping verb in the active voice:

Active voice: Who + Main verb ($V_1/V_2$) + Noun/Pronoun ........ ? <br>
Passive voice I: Preposition + whom + is/am/are/was/were + Noun/Pronoun + $V_3$ + ........? <br>
Passive voice II: Who + is/am/are/was/were + Noun/Pronoun + $V_3$ + Preposition + ................... ? 

Active voice: Who ***knows*** Mr. Costanza? <br>
Passive voice I: To whom ***is*** Mr. Costanza ***known***? <br>
Passive voice II: Who ***is*** Mr. Costanza ***known*** to? 


## Type 3: 'non-wh family'

### Concept 1

In the passive voice of ‘non-wh family’ interrogative sentences, we start the sentence with the helping verb that goes with the passive subject.

Active voice: Helping verb + Doer + Main verb + Noun/Pronoun + ........ ?  <br>
Passive voice: Helping verb + Noun/Pronoun + (some form of be) + $V_3$ + Preposition + Doer ...... ?  

Active voice: ***Have*** you ***stolen*** the diamond? <br>
Passive voice: ***Has*** the diamond ***been stolen*** by you?

Active voice: ***Are*** you ***repairing*** the car? <br>
Passive voice: ***Is*** the car ***being repaired*** by you ?

Active voice: ***Will*** you ***post*** this letter? <br>
Passive voice: ***Will*** this letter ***be posted*** by you?

### Concept 2

We follow the following structure in case of active voice interrogative sentences that start with do/does/did:

Active voice: Do/Does/Did + Doer + $V_1$ + Noun/Pronoun + ...... ? <br>
Passive voice: Is/Am/Are/Was/Were + Noun/Pronoun + $V_3$ + Preposition + Doer ....... ? 

Active voice: ***Do*** they ***beat*** you everyday? <br>
Passive voice: ***Are*** you ***beaten*** by them everyday? 

Active voice: ***Did*** she ***abuse*** you? <br>
Passive voice: ***Were*** you ***abused*** by her?

    <b>Explanation 1</b>: <br><br>
    Answer (d)<br><br>
    As the given sentence in Active voice is in Past Continuous tense, so it's passive form:<br><br>
    * will have the word 'being' and must be in present tense too - there are only two such options, a and d. <br><br>
    * will use 'is' after where - so d option is correct. 
    </p>
    <h5>Q2. Has anyone answered your call?</h5>
    <label for="quiz_q2a" class="quiz-label"><input type="radio" name="quiz_q2" value="20" id="quiz_q2a" class="quiz-input" />Has your call been answered?</label>
    <label for="quiz_q2b" class="quiz-label"><input type="radio" name="quiz_q2" value="-5" id="quiz_q2b" class="quiz-input" />Have your call been answered?</label>
    <label for="quiz_q2c" class="quiz-label"><input type="radio" name="quiz_q2" value="-5" id="quiz_q2c" class="quiz-input" />Anybody has answered your call?</label>

    <p id="quiz-exp2" style="display:none" class="toc-mak">
    <b>Explanation 2</b>: <br><br>
    Answer (a)<br><br>
    As the given sentence in Active voice is in Present Perfect tense, so it's passive form will have the word 'been' and must be in present tense too - there are only two such options, a and b. <br><br>
    As the passive subject 'call' is singular, so we must use a singlar helping verb 'has' - so option a is correct.<br><br>
    There's another reason why option c is incorrect - it's structure is wrong. It does not start with a helping verb. <br><br>
    We need not add 'by anyone' at the end. 
    </p>
    <h5>Q3. Why did he help you?</h5>
    <label for="quiz_q3a" class="quiz-label"><input type="radio" name="quiz_q3" value="-5" id="quiz_q3a" class="quiz-input" />Why was you helped by him?</label>

    <b>Explanation 3</b>: <br><br>
    Answer (b)<br><br>
    The 'Wh' family word (i.e. Why) will remain at the same place. <br><br>
    The given sentence is in past tense. So, we will convert 'did' into 'was/were'. <br><br>
    The object 'you' of the active voice will become the passive subject of the passive voice. The verb we use should agree with it. So, we will use 'were'. <br><br>
    Then comes the verb in $V_3$ form, i.e. helped. <br><br>
    The subject 'he' of the active voice will become the object of the preposition 'by'. As it's an object now, it will be in objective case, i.e. 'him'. 
    </p>
    <h5>Q4. How much does she love her mother?</h5>
    <label for="quiz_q4a" class="quiz-label"><input type="radio" name="quiz_q4" value="-5" id="quiz_q4a" class="quiz-input" />How much are her mother loved by her?</label>
    <label for="quiz_q4b" class="quiz-label"><input type="radio" name="quiz_q4" value="-5" id="quiz_q4b" class="quiz-input" />How much is her mother loved by she?</label>
    <label for="quiz_q4c" class="quiz-label"><input type="radio" name="quiz_q4" value="20" id="quiz_q4c" class="quiz-input" />How much is her mother loved by her?</label>
    <label for="quiz_q4d" class="quiz-label"><input type="radio" name="quiz_q4"  value="-5" id="quiz_q4d" class="quiz-input" />How much is she loving her mother?</label>
    <label for="quiz_q4z" class="quiz-label" style="display:none"><input type="radio" name="quiz_q4"  value="0" id="quiz_q4z" class="quiz-input" checked/>Invisible Radio button. Will pass a value of 0, if no radio button is selected by the student. It is checked by default. </label>

    <b>Explanation 4</b>: <br><br>
    Answer (c)<br><br>
    The 'Wh' family word (i.e. How) will remain at the same place. <br><br>
    The given sentence is in present tense. So, we will convert 'does' into 'is/am/are'. <br><br>
    The object 'her mother' of active voice will become the passive subject of the passive voice. The verb we use should agree with it. So, we will use 'is'. <br><br>
    Then comes the verb in $V_3$ form, i.e. loved. <br><br>
    The subject 'she' of the active voice will become the object of the preposition 'by'. As it's an object now, it will be in objective case, i.e. 'her'.

    <h5>Q5. Should I start a new business?</h5>
    <label for="quiz_q5a" class="quiz-label"><input type="radio" name="quiz_q5" value="-5" id="quiz_q5a" class="quiz-input" />Should a new business have been started by me?</label>

    <p id="quiz-exp5" style="display:none" class="toc-mak">
    <b>Explanation 5</b>: <br><br>
    Answer (d)<br><br>
    The object 'a new business' of the active voice will become the passive subject of the passive voice. <br><br>
    'Should start' will be transformed to 'Should be started' (modal + $V_1$ → modal + be + $V_3$) <br><br>
    The subject 'I' of the active voice will become the object of the preposition 'by'. As it's an object now, it will be in objective case, i.e. 'me'.
