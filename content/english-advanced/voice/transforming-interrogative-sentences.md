There are three categories of interrogative sentences from active-passive perspective:

* Type 1: interrogative sentence of ‘wh family’ - 'why', 'when', 'where’, 'how' and 'what’

* Type 2: interrogative sentence of ‘wh family’ – ‘who’, ‘whom’ and 'whose'.

* Type 3: interrogative sentence of ‘non-wh family’

## Type 1 'wh family'

### Concept 1

To make passive of an interrogative sentence of ‘wh family’ - 'why', 'when', 'where’, 'how' and 'what’ :

Active voice: Question word + Helping verb + Doer + Main verb + Object + ........? <br>
Passive voice: Question word + Helping verb + Passive subject + (some form of be) + $V_3$ + Preposition + Doer + .......... ? 

Just add the ‘wh' word at the start. 

Active voice: Why ***have*** you ***injured*** this puppy? <br>
Passive voice: Why ***has*** the puppy ***been injured*** by you?

Active voice: How ***can*** he ***love*** you? <br>
Passive voice: How ***can*** you ***be loved*** by him?

### Concept 2

We follow the following structure in case of active voice interrogative sentences that start with Question word + do/does/did:

Active voice: Question word + do/does/did (Helping verb) + Doer + $V_1$ (Main verb) + Noun/Pronoun + ........? <br>
Passive voice: Question word + is/am/are/was/were (Helping verb) + Noun/Pronoun + $V_3$ + Preposition + Doer + .......... ? 

That is, when the helping verb in active voice is do/does/did, we use is/am/are/was/were as helping verb in passive voice (and not do/does/did).

Active voice: Why ***did*** you ***hit*** her? <br>
Passive voice: Why ***was*** she ***hit*** by you?


## Type 2 'wh family'

<!-- ### Concept 1 -->

To make passive of an interrogative sentence of ‘wh family’ – ‘who’, ‘whom’ and ‘whose’, we follow different rules, because in these cases question word is the subject of active voice.

#### In case of 'Who'

In case there is a helping verb in the active voice:

Active voice: Who + Helping verb + Main verb + Noun/Pronoun ........ ? <br>
Passive voice I: Preposition + whom + Helping verb + Noun/Pronoun + (some form of be) + $V_3$ + ........? <br> 
Passive voice II: Who + Helping verb + Noun/Pronoun + (some form of be) + $V_3$ + Preposition + ................... ? 

Active voice: Who ***has beaten*** you? <br>
Passive voice I: By whom ***have*** you ***been beaten***? <br>
Passive voice II: Who ***have*** you ***been beaten*** by?

In case there is no helping verb in the active voice:

Active voice: Who + Main verb ($V_1/V_2$) + Noun/Pronoun ........ ? <br>
Passive voice I: Preposition + whom + is/am/are/was/were + Noun/Pronoun + $V_3$ + ........? <br>
Passive voice II: Who + is/am/are/was/were + Noun/Pronoun + $V_3$ + Preposition + ................... ? 

Active voice: Who ***knows*** Mr. Costanza? <br>
Passive voice I: To whom ***is*** Mr. Costanza ***known***? <br>
Passive voice II: Who ***is*** Mr. Costanza ***known*** to? 


## Type 3: 'non-wh family'

### Concept 1

In the passive voice of ‘non-wh family’ interrogative sentences, we start the sentence with the helping verb that goes with the passive subject.

Active voice: Helping verb + Doer + Main verb + Noun/Pronoun + ........ ?  <br>
Passive voice: Helping verb + Noun/Pronoun + (some form of be) + $V_3$ + Preposition + Doer ...... ?  

Active voice: ***Have*** you ***stolen*** the diamond? <br>
Passive voice: ***Has*** the diamond ***been stolen*** by you?

Active voice: ***Are*** you ***repairing*** the car? <br>
Passive voice: ***Is*** the car ***being repaired*** by you ?

Active voice: ***Will*** you ***post*** this letter? <br>
Passive voice: ***Will*** this letter ***be posted*** by you?

### Concept 2

We follow the following structure in case of active voice interrogative sentences that start with do/does/did:

Active voice: Do/Does/Did + Doer + $V_1$ + Noun/Pronoun + ...... ? <br>
Passive voice: Is/Am/Are/Was/Were + Noun/Pronoun + $V_3$ + Preposition + Doer ....... ? 

Active voice: ***Do*** they ***beat*** you everyday? <br>
Passive voice: ***Are*** you ***beaten*** by them everyday? 

Active voice: ***Did*** she ***abuse*** you? <br>
Passive voice: ***Were*** you ***abused*** by her?
