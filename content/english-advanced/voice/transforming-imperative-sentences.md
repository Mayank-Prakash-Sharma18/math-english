In imperative sentences subject ‘you’ is hidden.

There are three categories of imperative sentences from active-passive perspective:

* Imperative sentences with object

* Imperative sentences without object

* Imperative sentences giving moral suggestion


## Imperative sentences with object

We can make passive of such sentences in a few different ways. 

### Positive orders

In case of positive orders. <br>
Active Voice: Verb + Object <br>
Switch off the lights. 	

Method I: Let + passive subject + be + $V_3$ <br>
Passive Voice I: Let the lights be switched off. 		

Method II: You are ordered + (to + $V_1$) + object. <br>
Passive Voice II: You are ordered to switch off the lights.

Apart from ordered, we can use requested, forbidden, commanded, suggested, advised, prescribed, recommended, offered, proposed, allowed, permitted, referred etc, depending on the context and the kind of imperative sentence.  
{{% /alert %}}

Method III: Passive subject + is/am/are/was/were + to be + $V_3$ <br>
Passive Voice III: The lights are to be switched off. 

### Negative orders

In case of negative orders. <br>
Active Voice: Don’t/Never + Verb + Object <br>
Don’t switch off the lights. 	

Method I: Let + passive subject + not be + $V_3$ <br>
Passive Voice I: Let the lights not be switched off. 		

Method II: You are ordered+ not (to + $V_1$) + object. <br>
Passive Voice II: You are ordered not to switch off the lights.

Method III: Passive subject + is/am/are/was/were + not to be + $V_3$ <br>
Passive Voice III: The lights are not to be switched off.

In case of positive request.

Active Voice: Please/Kindly+ Verb + Object <br>
Please switch off the lights. 	

Passive Voice: You are requested+ (to + $V_1$) + object. <br>
You are requested to switch off the lights.

When ‘please’ is used in active voice then we use ‘requested’ in passive voice.

Active Voice: Please/Kindly+ don’t + Verb + Object <br>
Please don’t switch off the lights.

You are requested not to switch off the lights. 

### Positive advice

In case of positive advice.

Active Voice: Verb + Object <br>
Help the poor.

Passive Voice I: You are advised + (to + $V_1$) + object <br>
You are advised to help the poor. 

Passive Voice II: Passive subject + should be + $V_3$ (in case of moral suggestion we use this structure) <br>
The poor should be helped. 

### Negative advice

In case of negative advice.

Active Voice: Don’t/Never + Verb + Object <br>
Don’t help the greedy.

Passive Voice I: You are advised + not (to + $V_1$) + object <br>
You are advised not to help the greedy. 

Passive Voice II: Passive subject + should not be + $V_3$ (in case of moral suggestion we use this structure) <br>
Greedy should not be helped. 


## Imperative sentences without object

Active Voice: Get out. 

To make passive of such sentences we use: <br>
You are ordered/requested/forbidden etc. + (to + $V_1$)

Passive Voice: You are ordered to get out.

{{% alert note %}}
In active sentences without an object, there is only one way to make passive (i.e. you are ordered to, you are requested to, you are advised to). However, in active sentences with an object, we can make passive using other methods too.

## Imperative sentences giving moral suggestion

To make passive of such sentences we use: <br>

Passive Voice: The weak should be protected.
