## What is Calculus?

Calculus is a Latin word that means "pebble". It is a branch of Maths that tries to understand a bigger phenomenon by looking at its small pieces.

Here we find derivatives and integrals of functions, by methods originally based on the summation of infinitesimal differences. 


## Types of Calculus

Calculus has two main branches:

* ***Differential Calculus (Derivatives)*** – It is used to cut something into smaller pieces to find how it changes. Derivative of a function is the "rate of change" of that function, which is represented by the slope of that function. 

* ***Integral Calculus (Integration)*** – It is used to join (i.e. integrate) the smaller pieces together to find the total quantity, such as areas, volumes, central points, etc.
