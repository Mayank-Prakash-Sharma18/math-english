## What are Second Order Differential Equations? 

The highest derivative in a second order differential equation is the second derivative (i.e. $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$). 


## Various Methods for solving Second Order Differential Equations

### Undetermined Coefficients Method

We can use this method for non-homogeneous equations. 

$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + F(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + G(x) y = p(x)$ 

p(x) can be a polynomial, exponential, sine, cosine (or a linear combination of these functions). 

We are required to make some guesses in this method. 


### Variation of Parameters Method

This method can be applied to a wider range of functions as compared to Undetermined Coefficients Method.
