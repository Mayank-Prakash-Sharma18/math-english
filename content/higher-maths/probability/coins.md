Let us have a look at some probability questions based on <strong>Coins</strong>. 

##### Q. Three unbiased coins are tossed. What is the probability of getting:
A. All tails <br>
B. Two tails <br>
C. One tail <br>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">
Sample space S = {HHH, THH, HTH, HHT, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}, so a total of 8 possible outcomes. <br><br>

A. Favourable elementary events = {TT}, i.e. 1 favourable event. 
So, required probability = 1/8

B. Favourable elementary events = {HTT, THT, TTH}, i.e. 3 favourable events. 
So, required probability = 3/8

C. Favourable elementary events = {THH, HTH, HHT}, i.e. 3 favourable events. 
So, required probability = 3/8

Note: As the coin is unbiased, the probability of getting one tail will be the same as the probability of getting one head.
