Let us have a look at some probability questions based on <strong>Cards</strong>. 

A standard pack has 52 cards. In it there are 4 different suits: 
* Spades, Clubs - black in colour 
* Hearts, Diamonds - red in colour. 

Each suit has 13 cards â€“ 2, 3, 4, ..... 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace.

So, there are 26 red and 26 black cards. 

Ace, King, Queen and Jack are called "honours". There are four honour cards in each suit, i.e. a total of 16 honour cards in a pack of cards (8 red and 8 black). Not that, Jack is also called Knave.

Similarly, there are 9 number cards (2 to 10) in each suit.
