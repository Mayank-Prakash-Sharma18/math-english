## Formulae related to Square Prisms

### Formula 1: Volume

Volume of a Square Prism = Base Area × Height = $a^2$ × h

### Formula 2: Surface Area

Lateral surface area (i.e. area of the side faces) = Perimeter of base × Height = 4a × h

Total surface area = Lateral surface area + 2 × Area of base = 4ah + 2 × $a^2$
