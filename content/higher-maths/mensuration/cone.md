### What is a Cone?

A cone is a three dimensional solid structure, whose base is a circle and it has a vertex. 

The most famous type of cone is ***Right Circular Cone***. It is a cone whose vertex is directly over the center of its base circle.

When we just mention 'Cone', we generally mean a 'Right Circular Cone'.

When you roll a right-angled sector of a circle or semicircular sector of a circle, you get a cone without the base.

## Formulae related to Cone

If 'r' is the radius of its base, 'h' is its height, and 'l' is its slant height, then:

### Formula 1: Volume

Volume of cone = $\frac{1}{3}$ x Area of the base x Height = $\frac{1}{3} πr^2 h$

### Formula 2: Surface Area

Lateral/Curved Surface area of cone = $\frac{1}{2}$ x Perimeter of the base x slant height = πrl

Total Surface area of cone = Lateral surface area + Area of the base = π rl + π$r^2$  = π r(l + r)

Slant height, l = $\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$

### Formula 3: Frustum of a Cone

A frustum is the portion of a 3-D solid figure that lies between one or two parallel planes cutting it. 

For example, frustum of a cone, frustum of a pyramid, etc. 

To get frustum of a cone, we cut it by a plane parallel to its base. The portion of solid between this plane and the base of the original cone is known as the frustum of cone.
<img src="../../../media/mensuration/cone-frustum-1.svg" alt="Mensuration" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

Volume of the frustum of the cone = $\frac{1}{3} πh (r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_1r_2)$

Curved surface area of frustum of cone = $π(r_1 + r_2)s$, where s = $\sqrt{h^2 + (r_1 - r_2)^2}$

Total surface area of frustum of cone = $πs (r_1 + r_2)+ πr_1^2 + πr_2^2$, where s = $\sqrt{h^2 + (r_1 - r_2)^2}$
