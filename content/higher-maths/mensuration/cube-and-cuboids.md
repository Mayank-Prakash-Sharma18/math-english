### What is a Cube?

A cube is a three dimensional solid structure formed by six identical square faces joined along their edges. 
<img src="../../../media/mensuration/cube-1.png" alt="Mensuration" style="width:27%;height:27%;">

A cube has:
* 6 square faces of same shape and the same area. 
* 12 edges of equal length. 
* 8 vertices. 

In case of a Cuboid, at least some of the edges have different lengths. And so, the area of its faces may differ. So, we define it as follows. 

A cuboid is a three dimensional solid structure formed by six rectangular faces joined along their edges.

Let's understand these terms related cubes and cuboids. 


## Basic Terms related to Cubes and Cuboids

### Face, Edge and Vertex

***Face or Facet*** of a cube is its outer flat surface. 

A cube has 6 faces which are all squares, i.e. each one of them has four equal sides. On the other hand, the faces of a cuboid may be squares or rectangles. 

The line segment where two faces meet is called the ***Edge***. A cube/cuboid has 12 edges. 

The point where three edges meet is called the ***Vertex***. A cube/cuboid has 8 vertices.

### Diagonal

There are two types of diagonals that we deal with in case of Cubes and Cuboids. 

#### Face diagonals 

These are the line segments linking the two opposite corners of a face. 

A cube/cuboid has 6 faces and there are two face diagonals on each face. So, a cube/cuboid has 12 face diagonals.

#### Space Diagonal

This is a line segment comecting two vertices that are not on the same face of a cube/cuboid. 


## Formulae related to Cubes and Cuboids

* If 'a' is the side of a cube, and 
* l, b and h are the length, breadth, and height of a cuboid, then:

### Formula 1: Volume

In case of ***Cubes***:

* Volume of cube = Area of base × Height = $a^2$ × a = $a^3$ cubic units 

* Volume of hollow cube = Volume of material = Volume of whole cube - Volume of inner empty space = $a^3$ - $(a - 2x)^3$ <br>
(where x is the thickness of each face of the cube)

In case of ***Cuboids***:

* Volume of cuboid = Area of base × Height = lb × h = lbh cubic units 

* Volume of hollow cuboid = Volume of material = Volume of whole cuboid - Volume of inner empty space <br>
= lbh - (l - 2x) (b - 2x) (h - 2x) <br>
(where x is the thickness of each face of the cube)

### Formula 2: Surface Area

In case of ***Cubes***:

Lateral surface area of cube = Perimeter of base × Height = 4a × a = 4 $a^2$ square units

Total surface area of cube = 6 $a^2$ square units

{{% alert note %}}
Volume of cube = $(\sqrt{\frac{Total \hspace{1ex} Surface \hspace{1ex} Area}{6}})^3$ cubic units
{{% /alert %}}

In case of ***Cuboids***:

Lateral surface area of cuboid = Perimeter of base × Height = 2 (l + b) h square units

Total surface area of cuboid = 2 (lb + bh + lh) square units

### Formula 3: Diagonal

In case of ***Cubes***:
<img src="../../../media/mensuration/cube-2.png" alt="Mensuration" style="width:63%;height:63%;">

Face Diagonal of a Cube = $\sqrt{2}$ a units <br>

Space Diagonal of a Cube = $\sqrt{3}$ a units <br>

In case of ***Cuboids***:
<img src="../../../media/mensuration/cuboid-2.png" alt="Mensuration" style="width:90%;height:90%;">

There are three different Face Diagonals of a Cuboid, $\sqrt{l^2 + b^2}$, $\sqrt{l^2 + h^2}$ and $\sqrt{b^2 + h^2}$ units

Space Diagonal of a Cuboid = $\sqrt{l^2 + b^2 + h^2}$ units
