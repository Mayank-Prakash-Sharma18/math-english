## What is a Pyramid?

A Pyramid is a three dimensional polyhedron, such that:
* its base is a polygon (of any number of sides), and 
* the other faces are triangles with a common vertex, called the apex.

Apex of a Pyramid - It is a single point where all the triangular faces of a pyramid meet.

A pyramid with n-sided base has n + 1 vertices, n + 1  faces, and 2n edges. <br>
For example, in the above figure the base has 4 sides, and so the pyramid has 5 vertices, 5 faces, and 8 edges.

***Right Pyramid***: It is a pyramid whose axis is perpendicular to its base.

***Regular Pyramid***: It is a pyramid whose base is a regular figure, i.e. all sides of its base are equal.

A frustum is the portion of a 3-D solid figure that lies between one or two parallel planes cutting it. 

For example, frustum of a cone, frustum of a pyramid, etc. 

To get frustum of a pyramid, we cut it by a plane parallel to its base. The portion of solid between this plane and the base of the original pyramid is known as the frustum of pyramid.

## Formulae related to Pyramids

### Formula 1: Slant Height 

The slant height of a regular right-pyramid is the line-segment joining the vertex to the mid-point of anyone of the sides of the base. 
<img src="../../../media/mensuration/pyramid-4.png" alt="Mensuration" style="width:81%;height:81%;">

In the above figure, O is the centre of the base and AM is the slant height. <br>
Also, as ∆AOM is a right-angled triangle, so by Pythagoras theorem: <br>
$AM^2 = AO^2 + OM^2$ 

### Formula 2: Volume

Volume of a Pyramid = $\frac{1}{3}$ × Base Area × Height

### Formula 3: Surface Area

Lateral surface area = $\frac{1}{2}$ × Perimeter of base × Slant height

Total surface area = Lateral surface area + Area of base


## Types of Pyramids as per their Base

We already know that, base of a pyramid is a polygon of any number of sides. 

So, based on the kind of base, we get various types of pyramids. 
* Triangular pyramid (Tetrahedron) - have a triangular base with 3 sides. 
* Rectangular or Square pyramid - have a square/rectangular base with 4 sides. 
* Pentagonal pyramid - have a pentagonal base with 5 sides. 
* Hexagonal pyramid - have a hexagonal base with 6 sides. 
* and so on .....

We will study some of these pyramids in more detail in subsequent articles.
