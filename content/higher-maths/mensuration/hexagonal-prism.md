## What is Hexagonal Prism?

Hexagonal prism - has hexagonal bases with 6 sides.


## Formulae related to Hexagonal Prisms

### Formula 1: Volume

Volume of a Hexagonal Prism = Base Area × Height = $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} × a^2 × h$

### Formula 2: Surface Area

Lateral surface area (i.e. area of the side faces) = Perimeter of base × Height = 6a × h

Total surface area = Lateral surface area + 2 × Area of base = 6ah + 2 × $\frac{6\sqrt{3}}{4} × a^2$
