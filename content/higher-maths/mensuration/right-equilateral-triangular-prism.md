## What is Right Equilateral Triangular Prism?

Triangular prism - has triangular bases with 3 sides. 

Right Equilateral Triangular prism has equilateral triangles as its bases. 


## Formulae related to Right Equilateral Triangular Prisms

### Formula 1: Volume

Volume of a Right Equilateral Triangular Prism = Base Area × Height = $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} × a^2 × h$

### Formula 2: Surface Area

Lateral surface area (i.e. area of the side faces) = Perimeter of base × Height = 3a × h

Total surface area = Lateral surface area + 2 × Area of base = 3ah + 2 × $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} × a^2$
