## What is a Right Hexagonal Pyramid?

Right Square Pyramid has an hexagon as its base. Rest of its faces are congruent (exactly same) isosceles or equilateral triangles. So, its apex is directly above the center of its base.

## Formulae related to Right Hexagonal Pyramid

### Formula 1: Slant Height and Slant Edge

If h - height, a - side of base hexagon, l - slant height

Inradius of the hexagon as the base, r = $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ a <br>
Circumradius of the hexagon as the base, R = a 

By Pythagoras theorem: <br><br>
Slant height, l = $\sqrt{h^2 + r^2}$ = $\sqrt{h^2 + (\frac{\sqrt{3}a}{2})^2}$ <br><br>
Slant Edge = $\sqrt{h^2 + R^2}$ = $\sqrt{h^2 + a^2}$ 

### Formula 2: Volume 

Volume of a Pyramid = $\frac{1}{3}$ × Base Area × Height

So, Volume of a Right Hexagonal Pyramid = $\frac{1}{3}$ × Base Area × Height = $\frac{1}{3}$ × $\frac{6\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2$ × h

### Formula 3: Surface Area

Lateral surface area = $\frac{1}{2}$ × Perimeter of base × Slant height = $\frac{1}{2}$ × 6a × l

Total surface area = Lateral surface area + Area of base = $\frac{1}{2}$ × 6a × l + $\frac{6\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2$
