Let us see the various formulae that we can use:
* to find area of any general quadrilateral
* to find area of some specific kind of a quadrilateral, e.g. trapezium, rhombus etc. 

## Formulae for Area of Quadrilateral

### Formula 1 

Area of Quadrilateral = $\frac{1}{2}$ × One diagonal × Sum of perpendiculars on that diagonal from opposite vertices

Area of □ABCD = $\frac{1}{2}$ × BD × (AN + CM)

Basically its akin to adding the areas of two triangles, ABD and CDB. 

### Formula 2

Area of quadrilateral = $\frac{1}{2}$ × Product of two diagonals × sine of angle between the two diagonals

Area of □ABCD = $\frac{1}{2}$ × AC × BD × sin θ


## Formulae for Area of Cyclic Quadrilaterals

If the length of the sides of the cyclic quadrilateral are a, b, c and d, then:

Area of cyclic quadrilateral = $\sqrt{s (s - a) (s - b) (s - c) (s - d)}$

Where, s = $\frac{a + b + c + d}{2}$. It is called the semi-perimeter. 


## Formulae for Area of Parallelograms 

Here are a few formulae that we can use for any kind of a parallelogram. 

### Formula 1

Area of parallelogram = Base × Height

In the above figure, Area of parallelogram = AB × h

### Formula 2

If the length of two adjacent sides of a parallelogram are a and b, and length of any one of the diagonals is d, then:
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-6.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

Area of parallelogram = 2 $\sqrt{s (s - a) (s - b) (s - d)}$

Where, s = $\frac{a + b + d}{2}$. It is called the semi-perimeter. 

However, there are a few formulae that we can use for some specific kinds of parallelograms. Let's see these too. 

### Formula 3: For Rhombus

If the given parallelogram is a rhombus, the we can also use the following formula to find its area. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-12.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

Area of Rhombus = $\frac{1}{2}$ × Product of diagonals = $\frac{1}{2} × d_1 × d_2$

### Formula 4: For Square

If the given parallelogram is a square, then we can also use the following formula to find its area. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-15.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:45%;height:45%;">

Area of Square = $a^2$ = $\frac{d^2}{2}$

### Formula 5: For Circumscribed Square

<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-18.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:45%;height:45%;">

Side of circumscribed square, a = Diameter of the inscribed circle, d

Ratio of area of inscribed circle and area of circumscribed square = $\frac{π r^2}{a^2}$ = $\frac{π d^2/4}{a^2}$ = $\frac{π a^2/4}{a^2}$ = $\frac{π}{4}$

### Formula 6: For Rectangle

If the given parallelogram is a rectangle, then we can also use the following formula to find its area. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-19.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:63%;height:63%;">

Area of rectangle = Length x Breadth = l x b


## Formulae for Area of Trapezium

Area of trapezium = $\frac{1}{2}$ × (Sum of parallel sides) × Height
<img src="../../../media/geometry/trapezium-3.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

In the above figure, Area of trapezium = $\frac{1}{2}$ × (AB + CD) × h

## Properties related to Area of a Parallelogram

### Property 1

If two parallelograms have the same base (or same base length), and are between the same parallel lines (i.e. their height is the same), then their area will be equal.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-7.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:99%;height:99%;">
If AB ∥ PQ, then, Area of □ABCD = Area of □ABEF

This is beacuse area of a parallelogram is equal to the product of its base and height. If heights of two parallelograms are the same and the length of their bases too (as is the case above), then they obviously will have the same area.
