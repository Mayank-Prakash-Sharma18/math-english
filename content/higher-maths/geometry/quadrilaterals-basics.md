## What is a Quadrilateral?

Quadrilateral is a two-dimensional enclosed figure formed by joining four points on a plane. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-2.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:63%;height:63%;">

So, a quadrilateral has four vertices and four sides. 

Some examples of quadrilaterals are: Parallelogram, Trapezium, Kite etc. 


## Types of Quadrilaterals

### Parallelogram

It is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-1.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

* The opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel and are of equal length. 
* The opposite angles of a parallelogram are also equal. That is, ∠ A = ∠ C; ∠ B = ∠ D 

There are various kinds of parallelograms, such as Rhombus, Rectangle, Square. We will study about these in much more detail in a separate article. 

### Trapezium

It is a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-13.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

In the above figure, AB ∥ CD

That is, AB ∥ CD and BC = AD

### Kite

It is a quadrilateral in which two pairs of adjacent sides are equal. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-14.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:45%;height:45%;">

In the above figure, AB = AD, and CB = CD

* A Kite is not a parallelogram.

* Square and Rhombus are both Parallelogram and Kite.

### Cyclic Quadrilateral

Cyclic Quadrilateral is a kind of quadrilateral, all of whose vertices lie on the circumference of a circle.

### Circumscribed Quadrilateral 

Circumscribed Quadrilateral is a convex quadrilateral, all of whose four sides are tangent to a single circle within it. That's why it's also called Tangential Quadrilateral.

## Properties of Quadrilaterals

Let's see some of the properties shared by all types of quadrilaterals. 

### Property 1: Angle Sum

Sum of the four interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360°.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-2.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:63%;height:63%;">
In the above quadrilateral, ∠ A + ∠ B + ∠ C + ∠ D = 360°

Similarly, Sum of the four exterior angles of a quadrilateral is also 360°.

### Property 2

If we join the mid-points of the four sides of a quadrilateral, then we will get a parallelogram. The area of this parallelogram will be half of the original quadrilateral. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-3.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:63%;height:63%;">

In the above figure, on joining the mid-points of the sides of the quadrilateral □ABCD, we get a parallelogram PQRS. 

Area of parallelogram PQRS = $\frac{1}{2}$ × Area of □ABCD

If we join the mid-points of the four sides of a parallelogram, then we will get a parallelogram. The area of this parallelogram will be half of the original parallelogram. 

This is obvious, as a parallelogram is also a quadrilateral.

### Property 3

Angle made by the bisectors of any two consecutive angles = Half of the sum of the other two angles
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-8.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

In the above figure, ∠AOB = $\frac{1}{2}$ × (∠C + ∠D)

### Property 4

Sum of a pair of interior opposite angles = Sum of the pair of other two exterior opposite angles
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-9.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

In the above figure,  ∠x° + ∠y° = ∠p° + ∠q°

### Property 5

The line segment joining midpoints of any two adjacent sides is parallel and equal to half of corresponding diagonal.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-10.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

In the above figure, PQ ∥ AC and PQ = $\frac{1}{2}$ × AC

It is an application of the Thales theorem (or Basic proportionality theorem) that we read in triangle module.

### Property 6

Perimeter of a quadrilateral is always greater than the sum of its diagonals. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-11.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

In the above figure, AB + BC + CD + DA > AC + BD


## Properties of Kites

### Property 1: Diagonals

Diagonals of a Kite intersect at 90° and the shorter diagonal is bisected by the longer diagonal.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-15.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:45%;height:45%;">


## Properties of Cyclic Quadrilaterals

### Property 1: Sum of Opposite angles

In any cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of either pair of opposite angles = 180°.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-5.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

That is, ∠A + ∠C = 180° <br>
And, ∠B + ∠D = 180°

### Property 2

If the two diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD intersect each other at a point P, then:
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-7.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

AP × PC = DP × PB

### Property 3: In case of Square

Diagonal of inscribed square = Diameter of circle
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-17.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:45%;height:45%;">

## Properties of Circumscribed Quadrilaterals

### Property 1

Sum of opposite sides of a Circumscribed Quadrilateral are equal. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-12.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

In the above figure, AB + CD = BC + AD 

### Property 2: In case of Square

Side of circumscribed square = Diameter of the inscribed circle
