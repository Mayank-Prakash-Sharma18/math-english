## What is a Parallelogram?

Parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-1.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

* The opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel and are of equal length. 
* The opposite angles of a parallelogram are also equal. That is, ∠ A = ∠ C; ∠ B = ∠ D 

Now, let us see some of the most well known parallelograms. 


### Rhombus

It is a Parallelogram that has all four sides of equal length. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-10.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:45%;height:45%;">

It is also called as ***equilateral quadrilateral***, because it has four equal sides (just as we call a triangle with three equal sides equilateral triangle). 

So, Perimeter of a Rhombus = 4 × Side

### Rectangle 

It is a Parallelogram that has two diagonals of equal length, and all its four angles are right angles too (just like a square). However, only its opposite sides are equal. 

So, its adjacent sides make an angle of 90° with each other. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-4.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:63%;height:63%;">

AB = DC; BC = AD <br>
AC = BD <br>
∠ A = ∠ B = ∠ C = ∠ D = 90°

Perimeter of rectangle = 2 (length + breadth) = 2 (l + b)

If all the four sides of a rectangle are equal, then it is called a ***Square***. So, square is a special case of rectangle.

### Square

It is a Parallelogram that not only has all four sides of equal length (just like a rhombus), but all its angles are right angles too (just like a rectangle). <br>
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-11.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:36%;height:36%;">

So, Perimeter of a Square = 4 × Side

{{% alert note %}}
***Square*** - It is a Rectangle that has four sides of equal length. 

That is, all of its four angles are 90° each, and all of its four sides are equal too. 

So, in a way, square is a special case of rectangle.

## Properties of Parallelogram

These are the properties that are true for any kind of parallelogram. 

### Property 1: Angles 

In a parallelogram, sum of any two consecutive angles is always supplementary.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/quadrilateral-1.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

In the above figure, ∠A + ∠B = ∠B + ∠C = ∠C + ∠D = ∠D + ∠A = 180°

{{% alert note %}}
In case of ***Rhombus***: Pair of opposite angles are equal. 

In case of ***Rectangle and Square***: All angles are equal, as all angles are 90°.

### Property 2: Diagonals 

#### Property 2a

In a parallelogram, diagonals always bisect each other. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-1.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

In the above figure, AO = OC; DO = OB

#### Property 2b

Each diagonal of a parallelogram bisects that parallelogram into two congruent triangles.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-2.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

In the above figure, ∆ABD ≅ ∆CDB

#### Property 2c

Sum of squares of the sides of a parallelogram = Sum of the squares of its diagonals.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-1.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

In the above figure, $AC^2 + BD^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 + CD^2 + DA^2$

However, in a parallelogram the opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD, and BC = DA <br>
So, $AC^2 + BD^2 = 2 (AB^2 + BC^2)$

{{% alert note %}}
In case of ***Rhombus***: 
* Diagonals are not equal in length. 
* Diagonals bisect each other perpendicularly. 
* Diagonals are angle bisectors.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-13.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:63%;height:63%;">

Sum of the square of the diagonals = Four times the square of side, i.e. $d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 4 a^2$ 

In case of ***Square***: 
* Diagonals are equal in length (unlike Rhombus). 
* Diagonals bisect each other perpendicularly. 
* Diagonals are angle bisectors. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-15.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

Diagonal of a square = $\sqrt{2}$ Side, i.e. d = $\sqrt{2}$ a

In case of ***Rectangle***: 
* Diagonals are equal in length (like Square, unlike Rhombus). 
* Diagonals bisect each other (like Square and Rhombus), but not perpendicularly. (unlike Square and Rhombus)
* Diagonals are not angle bisectors. (unlike Square and Rhombus)
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-19.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

Diagonal of a rectangle = $\sqrt{l^2 + b^2}$

### Property 3: Angle bisectors of Parallelogram

#### Property 3a 

In a parallelogram, bisectors of any two consecutive angles make an angle of 90°. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-3.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

In the above figure, ∠AOB = 90°

#### Property 3b

Bisectors of the four angles of a parallelogram form a rectangle.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-4.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

In the above figure, PQRS is a rectangle. 

However, there are a few properties that are true only for some specific kinds of parallelograms. Let's see these too. 

### Property 4: Mid-point of sides

#### In case of Rhombus

Line segments joining midpoints of sides of a rhombus form a rectangle.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-14.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

In the above figure, PQRS is a rectangle. 

#### In case of Square

Line segments joining midpoints of sides of a square form a square.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-16.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:45%;height:45%;">

In the above figure, PQRS is a square. 

#### In case of Rectangle

Line segments joining midpoints of sides of a rectangle form a rhombus.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-20.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

In the above figure, PQRS is a rhombus. 

### Property 5: In case of Rectangle

If P is some point inside of a rectangle, then:
<img src="../../../media/geometry/parallelogram-21.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

$PA^2 + PC^2 = PB^2 + PD^2$
