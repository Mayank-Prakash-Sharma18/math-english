## What is a Triangle?  

A triangle is a plane and closed geometrical figure having three sides, i.e. it is bounded by three line segments.

So, a triangle has: 
* three sides 
* three angles  
* three vertices

### Basic Properties of a Triangle

There are some very basic properties of a triangle, that you must be aware of. 

* The sum of the three angles of a triangle will always be 180°.

* Sum of any two sides of a triangle will always be greater than the third side.

* Difference between any two sides of a triangle will always be less than the third side.


## Types of triangles (According to side)

### Equilateral Triangle

It is a triangle which has ***three equal sides***.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/triangle-01.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">
In the above figure, AB = BC = CA 

As all the sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, all of its angles are equal too (each angle is equal to 60°). That is, ∠ABC = ∠BCA = ∠CAB

### Isosceles Triangle

It is a triangle which has any of the ***two sides equal***. The third side is of a different length. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/triangle-2.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">
In the above figure, BC = CA 

As two sides of an isosceles triangle are equal, two of its angles are equal too. That is, ∠ABC = ∠CAB

{{% alert note %}}
* If two sides of a triangle are equal (BC = CA), then angles opposite to them are equal too (∠ABC = ∠CAB).
* If two angles of a triangle are equal (∠ABC = ∠CAB), then sides opposite to them are equal too (BC = CA).

### Scalene Triangle

It is a triangle having all unequal sides. That is, no two sides have the same length. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/triangle-3.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:72%;height:72%;">
As all the sides of a scalene triangle are unequal, all of its three angles are unequal too.

* If two sides of a triangles are unequal, then the bigger side has the greater angle opposite to it.
* If two angles of a triangle are unequal, then the greater angle has the bigger side opposite to it.

## Types of Triangles (According to angle)

### Acute-angled Triangle

All the three angles of an acute-angled triangle are acute angles, i.e. less than 90°.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/triangle-4.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

In acute angled triangle:

* Sum of any two angles would be greater than 90°. (Reason: If it's not, then the third angle will have to be more than 90°. In that case, the triangle will not be an acute-angled triangle.)

* If the lengths of the sides are a, b and c (the largest side being c), then $c^2$ < $a^2$ + $b^2$.

### Right-angled Triangle

In a right angled triangle, one of the angles is a right angle, i.e. exactly 90°.
<img src="../../../media/geometry/triangle-5.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:63%;height:63%;">

In right angled triangle:

* Sum of two other angles (apart from the right angle) would be equal to 90°. (Reason: We know that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°. If one angle is 90°, then the sum of the other two must be 90° too.) <br><br>
In other words, we can also say that if you ever find that in a triangle, the sum of two angles is equal to the third angle, then it means that it is a right-angled triangle. 

* If the lengths of the sides are a, b and c (the largest side being c, also called hypotenuse), then $c^2$ = $a^2$ + $b^2$.

### Obtuse-angled Triangle

In an obtuse angled triangle, one of the angles is an obtuse angle, i.e. more than 90°. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/triangle-6.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

In acute angled triangle:

* Sum of two other angles (apart from the obtuse angle) would be less than 90°. (Reason: If it's not, then the third angle will have to be less than 90°. In that case, the triangle will not be an obtuse-angled triangle.)

* If the lengths of the sides are a, b and c (the largest side being c), then $c^2$ > $a^2$ + $b^2$.


## Some more advanced properties of a triangle 

### Property 1

If a side of triangle is produced (say AB), then the exterior angle so formed (∠CBD) will be equal to the sum of the two interior opposite angles. That is, ∠CBD = ∠BCA + ∠CAB = x° + y°
<img src="../../../media/geometry/triangle-7.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

We find a similar property in case of quadrilaterals too. 

In a quadrilateral, exterior angle of a vertex is equal to sum of interior angles of other three vertices.

### Property 2

In an equilateral triangle, sum of perpendicular distances of all the three sides from any point inside of triangle is equal to height of the triangle. Let us take a point D inside the triangle, and from it drop perpendiculars on the sides. 
<img src="../../../media/geometry/triangle-9.png" alt="Geometry" style="width:54%;height:54%;">
In the above figure, the height of equilateral triangle ABC, h = DP + DQ + DR
