In this module we will learn about the basic concepts of Time, Speed and Distance.

## Time, Speed and Distance Formula

Speed - distance covered by a moving object in unit time.

So, Speed = $\frac{Distance}{Time}$

Or we can write the above formula as follows:

Distance = Speed × Time

##### Q. What is the speed of a person who travels 20 km in 5 hours?

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">
We know that:

Speed = $\frac{Distance}{Time}$ = $\frac{20}{5}$ = 4 km/hour

It means that the person travels 4 km in one hour. 
</div> <br>


## Units of Measurement of Time, Speed and Distance

Conversion of units of speeds: <br>
* x km/hr = x × $\frac{5}{18}$ = $\frac{5x}{18}$ m/sec <br>
* x m/sec = x × $\frac{18}{5}$ = $\frac{18x}{5}$ km/hr

(You can drive the above values if you put 1 km = 1000 m and 1 hour = 3600 seconds)

Every 18 kmph corresponds to 5 m/s. <br>
Thus 36 kmph = 10 m/s, 54 kmph = 15 m/s and 72 kmph = 20 m/s.

##### Q. If a person can cross a 1200 metre long bridge in 10 minutes, then what is his speed in km per hour?

<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1" onclick="openTab('1Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">2</button>

<div id="1Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 1: <br><br>

Time = 10 minutes = 10 × 60 = 600 seconds

Speed = $\frac{Distance}{Time}$ = $\frac{1200}{600}$ = 2 m/sec

x m/sec = x × $\frac{18}{5}$ = $\frac{18x}{5}$ km/hr = $\frac{36}{5}$ km/hr = 7.2 km/hr
</div>

<div id="1Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 2: <br><br>

Time = 10 minutes = 10 / 60 = 1/6 hour

Distance = 1200 metre = $\frac{1200}{1000}$ = 1.2 km

Speed = $\frac{Distance}{Time}$ = $\frac{1.2}{(1/6)}$ = 7.2 km/hr
</div><br>

## Other Formulae

### Formula 1

Formula for finding out the number of revolutions:

Distance, D = Circumference × n = 2πrn

Where, n = number of revolutions and r = Radius of circle

### Formula 2

Formula for finding the distance based on the count of the number of poles (e.g. when you are travelling in a train):

Total distance = (n - 1)x

Where, n = number of poles and x = Distance between consecutive poles.
