## What is Relative Speed?

Relative speed is the rate at which two moving bodies are separating from / coming closer to each other. 

OR

It is the speed of one moving body as observed, from the second moving body.

Generally, two cases arise in relative speed. 

## Objects moving in same direction 

Consider two objects A and B separated by a distance of d metres.

If these two objects A and B are moving in the same direction with speeds $S_1$ and $S_2$, then:

Their relative speed = |$S_1$ - $S_2$|

Time needed for them to meet = $\frac{Relative \hspace{1ex} Distance}{Relative \hspace{1ex} Speed}$ = $\frac{d}{|S_1 - S_2|}$ seconds

##### Q. A bully spotted a boy 150 meters away from him. Both of them started running in the same direction at the same time. If the speeds of the bully and the boy are 3 m/sec and 2 m/sec respectively, then in how much time will the bully catch up with the boy?

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Relative speed = 3 – 2 = 1 m/sec  (as both are running in the same direction) 

Time needed for them to meet = $\frac{Relative \hspace{1ex} Distance}{Relative \hspace{1ex} Speed}$ = 150/1 = 150 seconds (or 2 minutes and 30 seconds)
</div> <br>

## Objects moving in opposite directions 

Consider two objects A and B separated by a distance of d metres.

If these two objects are moving in opposite directions with speeds $S_1$ and $S_2$ (either towards each other or away from each other), then:

Their relative speed = $S_1$ + $S_2$

Time needed for them to meet  = $\frac{Relative \hspace{1ex} Distance}{Relative \hspace{1ex} Speed}$ = $\frac{d}{S_1 + S_2}$ seconds

##### Q. A bully spotted another bully 150 meters away from him. Both of them started running towards each other at the same time. If the speeds of the first bully and the second bully are 3 m/sec and 2 m/sec respectively, then in how much time will they meet?

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Relative speed = 3 + 2 = 5 m/sec  (as both are running towards each other, i.e. in opposite directions)

Time needed for them to meet = $\frac{Relative \hspace{1ex} Distance}{Relative \hspace{1ex} Speed}$ = 150/5 = 30 seconds
</div> <br>
