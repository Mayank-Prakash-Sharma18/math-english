Concept of base change is also applicable when product of two variables is constant.

Let there be two quantities x and y that multiply to form a quantity z. 
We can say: z = x × y

E.g. Total Expenditure = Price × Quantity <br>
Total Sales = Sales in volume × Price per unit<br>
Total Work = Efficiency × Time<br>
Distance = Speed × Time<br>
Area of rectangle = Length × Breadth<br>

* Say x or y is increased by a%, then:<br>
z = x (1 + 𝑎/100) × y = x y (1 + 𝑎/100) = z (1 + 𝑎/100)<br>
So increasing either x or y means that z is increased by the same percentage.<br>

Hence, we can compensate the increase in x by decreasing x in a proportionate manner.<br>
Or, we can compensate the increase in x by decreasing y in a proportionate manner.<br>
Or, we can compensate the increase in z by decreasing z in a proportionate manner.<br>
Answer will be the same in all the three cases.<br>

* If the x (say price of an item) goes up by p%, then y (the quantity consumed) should be decreased by ($\frac{p}{100+p}$) × 𝟏𝟎𝟎% so that the total expenditure remains the same.

###### Q. Price of a commodity has increased by 60%. By what percent must a consumer reduce the consumption of the commodity so as not to increase the expenditure ?
<pre>(a) 37%         (b) 37.5%          (c) 40.5%          (d) 60%</pre>
Explanations :<br>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1 default-tab" onclick="openTab('1Exp-1', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">1</button>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1" onclick="openTab('1Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">2</button>

<div id="1Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 1: Using Percentage Method <br>
Expenditure = Amount consumed × Price <br>
So, 60% increase in price is equivalent to 60% increase in expenditure.  <br><br>
Let initial value of Expenditure be 100  <br>
60% increase - 160 <br><br>
So, to revert back 160 to 100, the required percentage reduction needed in Expenditure = (60/160) × 100 = (3/8) × 100 = 37.5%<br>
</div>

<div id="1Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 2: Using Fraction Method<br>
60% = 3/5 <br><br>
5 corresponds to original number; 3 is the change<br>
As it’s an increase, the final number = 5 + 3 = 8 <br><br>
So, to revert back 8 to 5, the required percentage reduction needed in Expenditure = (3/8) × 100 = 37.5%<br>
</div>
