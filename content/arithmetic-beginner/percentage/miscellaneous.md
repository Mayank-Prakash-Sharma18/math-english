## Percent of a Percent
<br>
x% of y =  $\frac{x}{100}$ × y

z% of x% of y = $\frac{z}{100}$ × $\frac{x}{100}$ × y

and so on.

{{% alert note %}}
You will not that the order in which we apply these percentages is not important:

z% of x% of y = $\frac{z}{100}$ × $\frac{x}{100}$ × y

x% of z% of y = $\frac{x}{100}$ × $\frac{z}{100}$ × y

So, z% of x% of y = x% of z% of y

##### Q. What is 20% of 50% of 90?

Explanations :<br>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1 default-tab" onclick="openTab('1Exp-1', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">1</button>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1" onclick="openTab('1Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">2</button>

<div id="1Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 1:  <br><br>

50% of 90 = $\frac{50}{100}$ × 90 = 45

20% of 45 = $\frac{20}{100}$ × 45 = 9
</div>

<div id="1Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 2: Using the concept of Multiplying Factors<br><br>

20% of 50% of 90 = 0.2 × 0.5 × 90 = 9

## A percentage increase is how many times the original value?
<br>

If the percentage increase is 100%, then the new value of something is 2 times the previous given value.

If the percentage increase is 200%, then the new value of something is 3 times the previous given value.

If the percentage increase is 50%, then the new value of something is 1.5 times the previous given value.

So, we can generalize:

{{% alert note %}}
If the percentage increase is p%, then the new value of something is (1 + $\frac{p}{100}$) times the old value.

Or we can say that:

If the new value of something is p times the old value, then the percentage increase is (p - 1)100%.

##### Q. If salary of Mragank is increases by 150%, then his new salary is how many times his earlier salary?

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">
If the percentage increase is p%, then the new value of something is (1 + $\frac{p}{100}$) times the old value. <br><br>

So, New salary = (1 + $\frac{p}{100}$) times the earlier salary = (1 + $\frac{150}{100}$) times the earlier salary = 2.5 times the earlier salary 
</div> <br>

##### Q. If X = 5.25 Y, then by how much percent is X more than Y?

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">
X is 5.25 times the value of Y. <br><br>

So, Percentage increase from Y to X = (p - 1)100% = (5.25 -1)100 = 425%
</div> <br>

<br><hr><br>

## p times Vs. p times more
<br>

Compare these two:

* If the new value of something is <strong><span class="mak-text-color">p times</span></strong> the previous given value, then the percentage increase is (p - 1)100%.

* If the new value of something is <strong><span class="mak-text-color">p times more</span></strong> than the previous given value, then the percentage increase is 100p%.

##### Q. If price of onion increases to 3 times of its previous value, then what is the percent increase?

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">
If initial price was Rs 100, new price = Rs 300 <br>

If the new value of something is p times the previous given value, then the percentage increase is (p - 1)100%. <br>

So, Percentage increase = (p - 1)100% = (3 - 1)100 = 200%
</div> <br>

##### Q. If price of onion becomes 3 times more than its previous value, then what is the percent increase?

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">
If initial price was Rs 100, new price = 100 + 300 = Rs 400 <br>

If the new value of something is p times more than the previous given value, then the percentage increase is 100p%. <br>

So, Percentage increase = 100p% = 300%
</div> <br>
