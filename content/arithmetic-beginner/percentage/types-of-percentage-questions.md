In this article, we are going to have a look at the various kinds of questions formed on Percentage. 

## Type 1

##### Q. Rahul borrowed some money from his friend Sam and promised to pay it back in equal instalments, without interest. After paying 12 instalments he found that 75 percent of his loan was refunded. How many more instalments will he have to pay?
<pre>(a) 2   (b) 3    (c) 4   (d) 5</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

It's given that 75%, i.e. 3/4th of the loan is covered from 12 installments.

Hence, the number of installments needed to cover the rest of the 25%, i.e. 1/4th of the loan = [(1/4)/(3/4)] × 12 = (1/3) × 12 = 4 installments.

Answer: (c)
</div> <br>


## Type 2

##### Q. In which of the following options are the two numbers in the ratio 3:4?
(a) Two numbers are respectively 20% and 60% more than a third number. <br>
(b) Two numbers are respectively 30% and 50% more than a third number. <br>
(c) Two numbers are respectively 20% and 50% more than a third number. <br>
(d) None of these

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Checking option (a):

Let the third number be x. <br>
Then, first number = 120% of x = 120x/100 = 6x/5 <br>
Second number = 160% of x = 160x/100 = 8x/5

∴ Ratio of two numbers = (6x/5) : (8x/5) = 6 : 8 = 3 : 4

Answer: (a)
</div> <br>
