x as a percentage of y =  ùë•/ùë¶ √ó 100%    - y is the base

E.g. Mragank scores 60% marks. - So here maximum marks is the base

As percentage is given, the absolute marks obtained by Mragank will vary as base changes. <br>
60% marks, if maximum marks are 100 = 60  <br>
60% marks, if maximum marks are 120 = 72 

E.g. Mragank scores 60 marks.    - x is given 

As absolute marks obtained by Mragank are given, percentage will vary as base changes. <br>
Percentage of 60 marks, if maximum marks are 100 = 60%  <br>
Percentage of 60 marks, if maximum marks are 120 = 50% 

###### Q. Country A spends 2% and 3% of its GDP on health and education respectively. While country B spends 3% and 4% of its GDP on health and education respectively. 
(a) Expenditure on health by country A is less than the expenditure on health by country B <br>
(b) Expenditure on health by country A is more than the expenditure on health by country B <br>
(c) Expenditure on education by country A is less than the expenditure on education by country B <br>
(d) Country B spends more on education than on health. 

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">
We cannot compare the percentage values of country A and B as we do not know the bases, i.e. we do not know the absolute total GDP of either country A or B.<br>
However, we can compare the percentage values of the same country as the base will be the same. <br>
So, if total GDP of country B = y<br>
Then, 4% of y > 3% of y <br>
Answer: (d)
