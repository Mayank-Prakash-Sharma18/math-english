To find the Average of numbers in an Arithmetic Progression, we have three methods, depending on the kind of numbers provided to us.

## Method 1

In the Arithmetic Progression there are two cases:

* Series having odd number of terms
* Series having even number of terms

### Series having odd number of terms

When the number of terms is odd then the average will be the middle term.  

For example, in the sequence 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, the middle number is 7. <br>
So, mean/average of this series = 7.

### Series having even number of terms

When the number of terms is even then the average will be the average of two middle terms.

For example, in the sequence 5, 6, 7, 8, the middle terms are 6 and 7. <br>
So, mean/average of the series = (6 + 7)/2 = 13/2 = 6.5

Note: It will be difficult to use this method if the series is too long. Locating the middle term(s) will take some time.

## Method 2

In an A. P. with the first term a and the last term l. <br>
Average of the series = (a + l)/2.

For example, in the series 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, average = (5 + 9)/2 = 7. <br>
And in the series 5, 6, 7, 8, average = (5 + 8)/2 = 6.5.

Note: This method can be used if the series is too long.

## Method 3: For Consecutive Numbers

### General Formulae

We can use another method specifically to find average of Consecutive Natural Numbers beginning with 1.

* Average of first n consecutive natural numbers = $\frac{𝑛+1}{2}$

* Average of squares of first n consecutive natural numbers = $\frac{(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$

* Average of the cubes of first n consecutive natural numbers =  $\frac{n(n+1)^2}{4}$

### Formulae for consecutive even numbers

* Average of first n consecutive even numbers = (n + 1) <br>
E.g. Average of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 = (5 + 1) = 6

* Average of first n consecutive even numbers starting from 2 to x = $\frac{x + 2}{2}$  
E.g. Average of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 = (10 + 2)/2 = 12/2 = 6

* The average of square of first n consecutive even numbers = $\frac{2(n+1)(2n+1)}{3}$

* The average of square of first n consecutive even numbers starting from 2 to x = $\frac{(x + 1) (𝑥 + 2)}{3}$

### Formulae for consecutive odd numbers

* Average of first n consecutive odd numbers = n <br>
E.g. Average of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 = 6

* The average of first n consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 to x = $\frac{x+1}{2}$ <br>
E.g. Average of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 = (11 + 1)/2 = 12/2 = 6

* The average of square of first n consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 to x = $\frac{𝑥(𝑥 + 2)}{3}$
