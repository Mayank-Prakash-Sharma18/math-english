In this article, we are going to have a look at the various types of questions that are framed in aptitude examinations from the chapter of average. 

## Type 1

##### Q. Average marks of 40 students in a class is 60. Average marks of 25 students out of them is 54. What must be the average marks of the remaining students?
<pre>(a) 65   (b) 70    (c) 72.5   (d) 57</pre>

Explanations :<br>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1 default-tab" onclick="openTab('1Exp-1', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">1</button>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1" onclick="openTab('1Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">2</button>

<div id="1Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 1: Using Traditional Method <br><br>

Average marks of 40 students in a class is 60. <br>
Hence, the total marks of 40 students = 40 × 60

Average marks of 25 students out of them is 54. <br>
So, the total marks of 25 students = 25 × 54

Total marks of remaining 15 students = Total marks of 40 students - Total marks of 25 students = (40 × 60) – (25 × 54) = 2400 – 1350 = 1050

So, the average marks of the remaining 15 students = Total marks / Number of remaining students = 1050 / 15 = 70

Answer: (b)
</div>

<div id="1Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 2: Short Trick <br><br>

Average marks of 40 students in a class is 60. Average marks of 25 students out of them is 54.

Difference between the average marks = 60 - 54 = 6 <br>
Total deficit in average marks due to 25 students = 6 × 25

This deficit has to be covered by the rest of the 40 - 25 = 15 students. <br>
So, the marks above average that each of those 15 students need to score = (6 × 25)/15 = 10

So, the average marks of the remaining 15 students = Group Average + 10 = 60 + 10 = 70

Answer: (b)
