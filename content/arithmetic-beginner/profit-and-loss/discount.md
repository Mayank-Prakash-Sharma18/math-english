## Terms

### Marked price (MP) 

Marked price or mark up price (MP) is the price which the shopkeeper fixes in anticipation of some discount being asked by customer. 

Marked price (M.P.) = C.P. + markup

### Discount (D)

Discount means reduction of marked price to sell at a lower rate. It is calculated on the basis of marked price (M.P.)

SP = MP ‚Äì Discount = MP (1 ‚Äì Discount%/100)

[Note that (1 ‚Äì Discount%/100) is the multiplying factor.]

If no discount is given, then <br>
So, SP = MP

### Discount percentage

Profit or Loss percentage is always calculated on the cost price. Whereas, Discount percentage is calculated on marked price (or list price).

Discount percent = (Discount / MP) x 100

## Finding net profit/loss percentage

The shopkeeper buys at CP and then marks the item up by m% (of CP) to get MP. After that he gives a discount of d% (of MP) to get SP.

So, if a shopkeeper marks the products at m% above the cost price and gives the customer a discount of d%, then

final profit or loss % = m ‚àí ùëë ‚àí $\frac{(m √ó ùëë)}{100}$%   (successive percentage changes formula)

{{% alert note %}}
In terms of multiplying factors, $MF_{loss/profit}$ = $MF_{mark-up}$ √ó $MF_{discount}$ = (MP/CP) √ó (SP/MP) = SP/CP

Explanation 1: Percentage Method <br><br>

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss6.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

Let initial C.P. be Rs 100. Then, M.P. = 100 + 15% of 100 = Rs. 115 

Now, S.P. = 115 ‚Äì 20% of 115 = 115 - 23 = Rs. 92

{{% alert note %}}
Note: We can also calculate S.P. as follows: S.P. = (80/100) √ó 115 = Rs. 92
{{% /alert %}}

So, loss percentage = (loss/C.P.) √ó 100 = (8/100) √ó 100 = 8%

Explanation 2: Formula Method (using successive percentage changes formula)<br><br>

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss6.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

So, if a shopkeeper marks the products at m% above the cost price and gives the customer a discount of d%, then

final profit or loss % = m ‚àí ùëë ‚àí $\frac{(m √ó ùëë)}{100}$% = 15 ‚àí 20 ‚àí $\frac{(15 √ó 20)}{100}$% = -5 ‚Äì 3 = -8% <br>
(minus sign denotes that there has been a loss)

<div id="1Exp-3" class="Exp-3 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 3: Multiplying Factor Method<br><br>

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss6.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

In terms of multiplying factors, $MF_{loss/profit}$ = $MF_{mark-up}$ √ó $MF_{discount}$ = 1.15 √ó 0.80 = 0.92 

So, it means that SP/CP = 0.92

Hence, loss percentage = (1 ‚Äì 0.92) √ó 100 = 8%  

</div>

<div id="1Exp-4" class="Exp-4 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 4: Fraction Method <br><br>

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss6.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

15% = 3/20. So, if CP = 20, then MP = 20 + 3 = 23

20% = 1/5. So, if MP = 5, then SP = 5 ‚Äì 1 = 4

But we know MP is 23, so SP = (4/5) √ó 23 

So, if CP = 20, then SP = (4/5) √ó 23

Therefore, if CP = 100, then SP = (4/5) √ó 23 √ó (100/20) = 92

So, loss percentage = 8% 

{{% alert note %}}
Instead of doing all this, we can shorten our calculation by doing this:

15% = 3/20, so MP/CP = 23/20 <br>
20% = 1/5, so SP/MP = 4/5 <br>
So, SP/CP = (23/20) √ó (4/5) = 92/100 <br>

Hence, loss percentage = 8%

##### Q. A shopkeeper gives 30% discount on the clothes he sell, but still manages to make a profit of 5%. What must be the mark up percentage?

<div id="2Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group2">
Explanation 1: Percentage Method <br><br>

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss7.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

Let CP = Rs. 100

As he makes a profit of 5%, so SP = 100 + 5% of 100 = Rs. 105

As 30% discount was given, we can say that 70% is equivalent to Rs. 105 <br>
Hence, 100% will be equivalent to 105 √ó (100/70) = Rs. 150 

So, mark-up percentage = (50/100) √ó 100 = 50%
</div>

<div id="2Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group2">
Explanation 2: Fraction Method  <br><br>

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss7.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

30% discount = 3/10, so SP/MP = 7/10 <br>
5% profit = 1/20, so SP/CP = 21/20 <br>
So, MP/CP = (10/7) √ó (21/20) = 3/2 = 1.5 <br>

Hence, mark-up percentage = 50% 
</div>

<div id="2Exp-3" class="Exp-3 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group2">
Explanation 3: Traditional Method  <br><br>

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss7.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

Let C.P. = Rs. 100 and the mark up percentage be x%. <br>
Hence, M.P. = Rs. 100 + x <br>
And S.P. = 70% of (100 + x) = 0.70 (100 + x)

As he makes a profit of 5%, his S.P. must be Rs. 105.

So, 0.70 (100 + x) = 105 <br>
or 70 + 0.7x = 105 <br>
or 0.7x = 35 <br>
or x = 50%
