## CP of 'a' articles = SP of 'b' articles

If cost price of ‚Äòa‚Äô articles is equal to the selling price of ‚Äòb‚Äô articles, then 
Profit/loss percent = $\frac{a - b}{b}$ √ó 100

If a > b, it is profit percentage; if a < b, it is loss percentage.

##### Q. If cost price of 20 articles is equal to the selling price of 15 articles, then find the profit/loss percent.

<div id="1Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 1: Using Traditional Method <br><br>

Let C.P. of  article = Rs. x <br>
So, C.P. of 20 articles = Rs. 20x

Selling price of 15 articles = Cost price of 20 articles = 20x <br>
So, Selling price of 1 article = Rs. 20x/15 = Rs. 4x/3

Profit percent = [(S.P. ‚Äì C.P.) / C.P.] √ó 100 = [(x/3)/x] √ó 100 = 33.33%
</div>

<div id="1Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 2: Using Formula Method<br><br>

If cost price of ‚Äòa‚Äô articles is equal to the selling price of ‚Äòb‚Äô articles, then  <br>
Profit/loss percent = ((a‚àíb))/b √ó 100 = ((20‚àí15))/15 √ó 100 = 5/15 √ó 100 = 33.33% 
</div>

<div id="1Exp-3" class="Exp-3 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 3: <br><br>

Let number of articles be 20.

We get the C.P. back by just selling 15 articles. So, 5 articles are left, the S.P. of which is our profit.<br>
So, profit = S.P. of 5 articles AND C.P. = S.P. of 15 articles 

Profit percent = (profit/C.P.) √ó 100 = (S.P. of 5 articles/S.P. of 15 articles) √ó 100 = (5/15) √ó 100 = 33.33%

<div id="2Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group2">
Explanation 1: Using Traditional Method <br><br>

C.P. of 12 articles = Rs. 15 <br>
So, C.P. of 1 article = Rs. 15/12 = Rs. 5/4

S.P. of 8 articles = Rs. 12 <br>
So, S.P. of 1 article = Rs. 12/8 = Rs. 3/2

Profit percent = [(S.P. ‚Äì C.P.) / C.P.] √ó 100 = [(1/4)/(5/4)] √ó 100 = 20%
</div>

<div id="2Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group2">
Explanation 2: Using Formula Method<br><br>

To apply the formula, we need to make C.P. = S.P. 

L.C.M (15, 12) = 60

Cost price of 12 articles is Rs. 15 <br>
So, cost price of 48 articles is Rs. 60 

Selling price of 8 articles is Rs. 12 <br>
So, cost price of 40 articles is Rs. 60 

If cost price of 48 articles is equal to the selling price of 40 articles, then  <br>
Profit/loss percent = ((a‚àíb))/b √ó 100 = ((48‚àí40))/40 √ó 100 = 8/40 √ó 100 = 20%

Explanation 3: <br><br>

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss1.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:99%;height:99%;">
Profit/loss percent = ((144‚àí120))/120 √ó 100 = 24/120 √ó 100 = 20%

##### Q. A shopkeeper buys some articles at a rate of 9 articles for Rs. 3. If he sells all of them at a rate of 4 articles for Rs. 2, and makes a profit of Rs. 36, then find the number of articles purchased. 

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss2.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:99%;height:99%;">
Profit of 18 ‚Äì 12 = Rs 6 on 9 articles <br>
So, profit of Rs. 36 will be on (9/6) √ó 36 = 54 articles
</div> <br>


## Same SP of two items

### Concept 1: Finding Ratio of C.P.s

When SP of two articles are same:

(a) First one is sold at a profit of x% and second one is sold at a profit of y%. <br>
Then Ratio of $CP_1$ : $CP_2$ = (100 + y) : (100 + x)

(b) First one is sold at a profit of x% and second one is sold at a loss of y%. <br>
Then, Ratio of $CP_1$ : $CP_2$ = (100 ‚Äì y) : (100 + x)

(c) First one is sold at a loss of x% and second one is sold at a profit of y%. <br>
Then, Ratio of $CP_1$ : $CP_2$ = (100 + y) : (100 ‚Äì x)

(d) First one is sold at a loss of x% and second one is sold at a loss of y%. <br>
Then, Ratio of $CP_1$ : $CP_2$ = (100 ‚Äì y) : (100 ‚Äì x)

### Concept 2: Finding net profit/loss percentage 

A person sells two objects at the same price, one at a profit/loss of a% and another at a profit/loss of  b%. 

Then, net profit/loss percentage = $\frac{100 (a + b) + 2ab}{200 + a + b}$

{{% alert note %}}
Note: <br>
(a) we use - sign for a, b in case of loss and + sign in case of profit. <br>
(b) If the formula evaluates to a negative value, it means there is a net loss and vice-versa.

<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group3" onclick="openTab('3Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group3', 'tabcontent-group3')">2</button>

<div id="3Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group3">
Explanation 1: Using Traditional Method <br><br>

Let S.P. of both cars be Rs. x

Then C.P. of first car = [100/(100 + Profit%)] √ó SP = [100/(100 + 10%)] √ó x = Rs. 10x/11

And C.P. of second car = [100/(100 - Loss%)] √ó SP = [100/(100 - 20%)] √ó x = Rs. 5x/4

Required ratio = (10x/11) : (5x/4) = 8/11, i.e. 8 : 11
</div>

<div id="3Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group3">
Explanation 2: Using Trick Method  <br><br>

When SP of two articles are same: <br>
First one is sold at a profit of x% and second one is sold at a loss of y%. <br>
Then, Ratio of CP1 : CP2 = (100 ‚Äì y) : (100 + x) = (100 - 20) : (100 + 10) = 80 : 110 = 8:11
</div><br>


### Concept 3: Special Case

If SP of two articles are same and one is sold at a profit of x% and another is sold at a loss of x%, then in that case there will always be a loss. 

‚à¥ Loss percentage = $\frac{ùë•^2}{100}$ = ($\frac{x}{10})^2%$

{{% alert note %}}
Note: We can drive this formula using the net profit/loss percentage formula. <br>

Net profit percentage = $\frac{100 (a + b) + 2ab}{200 + a + b}$ = $\frac{100 (x - x) ‚Äì 2x^2}{200 + x - x}$ = ‚Äì $\frac{2ùë•^2}{200}$ = ‚Äì ($\frac{ùë•}{10})^2%$
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert note %}}
If CP of two articles are same and one is sold at a profit of x% and another is sold at a loss of x%, then in that case there will be neither a loss nor any profit.

<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group4" onclick="openTab('4Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group4', 'tabcontent-group4')">2</button>

<div id="4Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group4">
Explanation 1: Traditional Method <br><br>

Let S.P. of both shirts be Rs. x

Then C.P. of first shirt = $\frac{100}{(100 + Profit \hspace{1ex} Percent)}$ √ó SP = $\frac{100}{(100 + 10)}$ √ó x = Rs. $\frac{10x}{11}$ 

And C.P. of second shirt = $\frac{100}{(100 - Loss \hspace{1ex} Percent)}$ √ó SP = $\frac{100}{(100 - 10)}$ √ó x = Rs. $\frac{10x}{9}$ 

Total C.P. = $\frac{10x}{11}$ + $\frac{10x}{9}$ = Rs. $\frac{200x}{99}$ 

Total S.P. = Rs. 2x

Loss = $\frac{200x}{99}$ ‚Äì 2x = Rs. $\frac{2x}{99}$ 

Required loss percent = $\frac{\frac{2x}{99}}{\frac{200x}{99}}$ √ó 100 = 1%

</div>

<div id="4Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group4">
Explanation 2: Formula Method  <br><br>

If SP of two articles are same and one is sold at a profit of x% and another is sold at a loss of x%, then in that case there will always be a loss. 

‚à¥ Loss percentage = $\frac{ùë•^2}{100}$% = ($\frac{ùë•}{10})^2$% = ($\frac{10}{10})^2$% = 1%

<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group5" onclick="openTab('5Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group5', 'tabcontent-group5')">2</button>

<div id="5Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group5">
Explanation 1: Traditional Method <br><br>

Let C.P. of both shirts be Rs. x

Then S.P. of first shirt = x + 10% of x = Rs. 1.1 x

And S.P. of second shirt = x ‚Äì 10% of x = Rs. 0.9 x

Total C.P. = Rs, 2x

Total S.P. = 1.1 x + 0.9 x = Rs. 2x

Loss = 2x ‚Äì 2x = Rs. 0

Required loss percent = $\frac{0}{2x}$ √ó 100 = 0%

</div>

<div id="5Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group5">
Explanation 2:  <br><br>

Let C.P. of a shirt be Rs. x

In first transaction we get 10% of Rs. x as profit.

In second transaction we get 10% of Rs. x as loss.

Hence, there is neither gain nor loss, in the overall transaction.

</div><br>


### Concept 4: Finding individual C.P., when total C.P. given

A person buys two articles for x. He sells one at a profit of a% and the other at a loss of b%. If each item was sold at the same price, then

C.P. of the article sold in profit = $\frac{x(100 - b)}{200 + a - b}$

C.P. of the article sold in loss = $\frac{x(100 + a)}{200 + a - b}$

## Things sold in parts

### Concept 1: Finding overall gain or loss percentage

We already saw how to find overall gain or loss percentage in case there are two items, whose S.P. is the same. 

However, sometimes more items are involved and the S.P. is not necessarily the same. 

Let‚Äôs see how to solve such questions. 

##### Q. Some apples are purchased for Rs. 400. One fourth of the apples are sold at a loss of 10% and the remaining at a gain of 20%. What is the overall gain or loss percentage? 

Explanations :<br>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group6 default-tab" onclick="openTab('6Exp-1', this, 'tablink-group6', 'tabcontent-group6')">1</button>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group6" onclick="openTab('6Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group6', 'tabcontent-group6')">2</button>

<div id="6Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group6">
Explanation 1: Traditional Method <br><br>

C.P. = Rs. 400

S.P. of one-fourth apples = (1/4) √ó 400 √ó (90/100) = Rs. 90

S.P. of the remaining three-fourth apples = (3/4) √ó 400 √ó (120/100) = Rs. 360

Total S.P. = 90 + 360 = Rs. 450

So, gain = S.P. ‚Äì C.P. = 450 ‚Äì 400 = Rs. 50

Gain percent = (Gain/C.P.) √ó 100 = (50/400) √ó 100 = 12.5%

</div>

<div id="6Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group6">
Explanation 2: Alligation Method  <br><br>

Let overall gain/loss percent be x. Some apples are sold at a loss of 10% and the remaining at a gain of 20%.

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss3.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:45%;height:45%;">

(x ‚Äì 20) : (-10 - x) = (1/4) : (3/4)

Or 3 (x - 20) = -10 ‚Äì x

Or 3x ‚Äì 60 = -10 ‚Äì x

Or x = 12.5% 

So, overall gain percentage = 12.5% 

</div><br>

### Concept 2: Finding total C.P. 

If ‚Äòa‚Äô part of an article is sold at x% profit or loss, ‚Äòb‚Äô part at y% profit or loss and ‚Äòc‚Äô part at z% profit or loss and finally there is a profit or loss of p, 

Then, cost price of entire articles = $\frac{p√ó100}{(¬±ax¬±by¬±cz)}$

### Concept 3: Finding S.P. of a part so that net gain = 0

If pth part of an item is sold at x% loss, then 

Required gain percent in selling rest of the item in order that there is neither gain nor loss in whole transaction = $\frac{px}{(1‚àíp)}$%

##### Q. One-third of the pencils are sold at a loss of 20%, then at what percent of profit should the rest of them be sold so that there is no overall gain or loss percentage? 

Explanations :<br>

<div id="7Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group7">
Explanation 1: Traditional Method <br><br>

Let C.P. = Rs. 300

S.P. of one- third pencils = (1/3) √ó 300 √ó (80/100) = Rs. 80

As there is no overall gain or loss percentage, Total S.P. = Total C.P. = Rs. 300 

So, S.P. of rest of the two- third pencils = 300 ‚Äì 80 = Rs. 220

So, Gain = S.P. ‚Äì C.P. = 220 ‚Äì 200 = Rs. 20

Required Gain percent = (Gain/C.P.) √ó 100 = (20/200) √ó 100 = 10%

</div>

<div id="7Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group7">
Explanation 2: Alligation Method  <br><br>

Overall gain/loss percent is 0%. Some pencils are sold at a loss of 20% and let the remaining at a gain of x%.

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss4.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:45%;height:45%;">

(0 ‚Äì x) : (-20 - 0) = (1/3) : (2/3)

Or -2x = -20

Or x = 10% 

So, required gain percentage = 10% 

</div>

<div id="7Exp-3" class="Exp-3 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group7">
Explanation 3: Formula Method <br><br>

If pth part of an item is sold at x% loss, then 

Required gain percent in selling rest of the item in order that there is neither gain nor loss in whole transaction = $\frac{px}{(1‚àíp)}$% 

Here, p = $\frac{1}{3}$

So, required gain percentage = $\frac{px}{(1‚àíp)}$% = $\frac{(\frac{1}{3})20}{1‚àí(\frac{1}{3})}$% = 10%
