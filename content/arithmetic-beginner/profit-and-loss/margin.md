Margin - the profit percentage on selling price.

#### How to convert profit percentage into margin and vice-versa?

Here we will basically be dealing with a base change (concept of base change has been dealt in percentage chapter).

##### 10% profit is equivalent to what margin?
Let CP be Rs. 100 <br>
So, Profit = 10% of CP = 10% of 100 = Rs. 10 <br>
And SP = CP + Profit = 100 + 10 = Rs. 110. <br>
So, Margin = Profit/SP = 10/110 = 1/11 = 9.09% <br>

##### 10% margin is equivalent to what profit percentage?
Let SP be Rs. 100 <br>
So, Margin = 10% of SP = 10% of 100 = Rs. 10 <br>
And CP = SP – Margin = 100 – 10 = Rs. 90. <br>
So, profit percentage =  Profit/CP = 10/90 = 11.11%

##### Q. Profit on selling price is 20% What must be the actual profit percentage?

Explanation 1: Using Percentage Method <br><br>

Let's assume selling price to be Rs 100 <br>
Profit = 20% of selling price = 20% of 100 = Rs. 20 <br>
So, Cost price = 100 - 20 = Rs 80 <br>

Hence, Actual profit percentage (with C.P. as the base) = (20/80) x 100 = 25%
</div>

<div id="1Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 2: Using Fraction Method<br><br>

Profit = 20% = 1/5 <br>
If S.P. = 5, then profit = 1 <br>
So, C.P. = 5 – 1 = 4 <br>

Hence, Actual profit percentage (with C.P. as the base) = (1/4) x 100 = 25%
