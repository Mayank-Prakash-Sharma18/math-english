In this article, we are going to have a look at the various kinds of questions formed on Profit and Loss. 

## Type 1: Items buyed at one price and sold at another

### Type 1a

##### Q. Gaurav purchased an article at 4/5th of its marked price and sold it at 20% more than the marked price. What was Gaurav’s profit percent?
<pre>(a) 50%   (b) 40%    (c) 20%   (d) 25%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let marked price = 50 units

For Gaurav, cost price of the article = 4/5th of its marked price = 40 units <br>
Now, Selling price of the article = (50 x 120)/100 = 60 units

So, the required profit percentage = [(60 - 40)/40] x 100 = (20/40) x 100 = 50%

Answer: (a)
</div> <br>

### Type 1b

##### Q. Some items were bought at 8 items for Rs. 5 and sold at 5 items for Rs. 8. What is the profit percentage?
<pre>(a) 108%   (b) 56%    (c) 156%   (d) 68%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the number of items bought = L.C.M. of 8 and 5 = 40.

C.P. of 40 items = (5/8) × 40 = Rs. 25 <br>
S.P. of 40 items = (8/5) × 40 = Rs. 64

So, profit percentage = (39/25) × 100 = 156%

Answer: (c)
</div> <br>


## Type 2

##### Q. Government announced that if an electricity bill is paid before due date, one gets a concession of 5% on the amount of the bill. By paying a bill before due date, a person got a concession of Rs. 17. What was the original amount of his electricity bill?
<pre>(a) Rs. 325   (b) Rs. 350    (c) Rs. 340   (d) Rs. 334</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the original amount of bill = Rs. x

According to the question, <br>
5% of x = Rs. 17 <br>
Or 5x/100 = 17 <br>
Or x = (17 x 100)/5 = Rs. 340

Answer: (c)
</div> <br>


## Type 3: Profit/Loss in terms of SP

We know that Profit/Loss percentage is calculated on the basis of the Cost Price (CP). However, what if we are given Profit/Loss percentage as compared to the Selling Price (SP)?

Let's see some of such questions. 

##### Q. A person sells an article at a profit which is 25% of the selling price. If the cost price is reduced by 10% and he also reduces the selling price by 10%, then what is the profit percentage on the cost price?
<pre>(a) 30%   (b) 33.33%    (c) 33.67%   (d) 15%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let SP = 40 units <br>
Hence, Profit = 25% of S.P. = 1/4 of S.P. = 10 units <br>
So, C.P. = S.P. – Profit = 40 – 10 = 30 units

As Cost price is reduced by 10%, New CP = (30 x 90)/100 = 27 units <br>
Similarly, Selling price is reduced by 10%, so new SP = (40 x 90)/100 = 36 units <br>
New profit = SP – CP = 36 – 27 = 9 units

So, new profit percentage = (9/27) x 100 = 33.33%

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>


## Type 4: Profit = CP/SP of n items

### Type 4a: Profit = CP of n items

##### Q. By selling 24 litres of juice at Rs. 50 per litre, a merchant earns a profit equivalent to the cost price of 6 litres. What must be his profit percentage?
<pre>(a) 15%   (b) 25%    (c) 20%	   (d) 18%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let cost price per litre of juice be Rs. x <br>
So, cost price of 24 litres of juice = 24x, and profit = 6x 

Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) X 100 = (6x/24x) X 100 = 25%

{{% alert note %}}
The information regarding the price of the juice (Rs. 50 per litre) is redundant, i.e. it's not required to solve the question. You will often be provided with redundant data in quant questions just to confuse you a bit. 
{{% /alert %}}

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>

### Type 4b: Profit = SP of n items

##### Q. A shopkeeper sells 100 pens, and in the process gains the selling price of 40 pens. What is the profit percentage?
(a) 40% <br>
(b) 66.67% <br>
(c) 33.33% <br>
(d) Cannot be determined

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the cost price of one pen = C <br>
And the selling price of one pen = S

As given in the question,
100S – 100C = 40S <br>
Or 60S = 100C <br>
Or S = 5C/3

So, Gain Percent = [(SP - CP)/CP] × 100 % = [(5C/3 - C)/C] × 100% = (2/3) × 100% = 66.67%

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>


## Type 5: SP of n items is equal to CP of m items

##### Q. If the selling price of 10 articles is equal to the cost price of 12 articles, then what is the gain percent? 
<pre>(a) 10%   (b) 15%    (c) 11%   (d) 20%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the cost price of each article be Rs. 1 <br>
∴	Cost price of 10 articles = Rs. 10

As we know that the selling price of 10 articles is equal to the cost price of 12 articles. <br>
∴	Selling price of 10 articles = Rs. 12

Now, Profit percent = [(S.P - C.P)/(C.P)] × 100 = (12 - 10)/10 × 100 = 20%.

Answer: (d)
</div> <br>


## Type 6: Mixed and Sold

##### Q. Setu purchased a certain number of articles at Rs. 10 each, and the same number of another articles for Rs. 16 each. He mixed them together and sold them for Rs. 14 each. What is his gain or loss percent?
(a) Loss of 7.69% <br>
(b) Loss of 7.14% <br>
(c) Gain of 7.69% <br>
(d) Gain of 7.14%

Explanations :<br>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1 default-tab" onclick="openTab('1Exp-1', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">1</button>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1" onclick="openTab('1Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">2</button>

<div id="1Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 1: <br><br>

Let us assume that he bought 10 articles of each kind.

∴	Total cost = Rs. (10 × 10 + 16 × 10) = Rs. 260 <br>
Total selling price = Rs. (14 × 20) = Rs. 280

∴	Gain percentage = [(S.P. - C.P.)/(C.P.)] × 100 = [(280 - 260)/260] × 100 = (20/260) × 100 = 7.69%
</div>

<div id="1Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 2: <br><br>

As the number of articles bought are the same in both the cases, the Average C.P. = (10 + 16)/2 = Rs. 13

S.P. = Rs. 14

∴	Gain percentage = [(S.P. - C.P.)/(C.P)] × 100 = [(14 - 13)/(13)] × 100 = (1/13) × 100 = 7.69%
</div><br>


## Type 7: Two items sold

### Type 7a: CP is same

##### Q. Mak buys 2 books for Rs. 600 each, and makes a profit of 15% on one of them and incurs a loss of 15% on the other. What is the overall profit/loss on the entire transaction?
(a) Rs. 36 loss	<br>
(b) Rs. 38 loss <br>
(c) Rs 36 profit <br>	
(d) None of the above

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

SP of the first book = 600 + 15% of 600 = 600 + 90 = Rs. 690 <br>
SP of the second book = 600 - 15% of 600 = 600 - 90 = Rs. 510

Total SP = 690 + 510 = Rs. 1200 <br>
Total CP = 2 x 600 = Rs. 1200

Hence, there is no profit or loss. 

{{% alert note %}}
As the CP or the base is the same, and the profit and loss percent is also the same, so it's obvious that the net profit/loss would be 0.

Answer: (d)
</div> <br>

### Type 7b: SP is same

##### Q. Mak sells 2 books for Rs. 782 each, thereby making a profit of 15% on one of them and incurring a loss of 15% on the other. What is the overall profit/loss on the entire transaction?
(a) Rs. 36 loss	<br>
(b) Rs. 38 loss <br>
(c) Rs 36 profit <br>	
(d) Rs. 38 profit

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the cost price of the book on which Mak earns profit be Rs. x and that of the book on which he incurs loss be Rs. y.

Thus, 1.15x = 782 and 0.85y = 782 <br>
Solving them, we get: x = 680 and y = 920

Total cost or CP = 680 + 920 = Rs. 1600 <br>
Total SP = 2 x 782 = Rs. 1564

Hence, there is a loss of Rs. (1600 — 1564), i.e. Rs. 36

Answer: (a)
</div> <br>

### Type 7c: Profit/Loss is same

##### Q. Two items A and B are sold at a profit of 10% and a loss of 20%, respectively. If the amount of profit and loss is the same, then what may be the cost prices of A and B, respectively?
(a) Rs. 1,500 & Rs. 1,000 <br>
(b) Rs. 2,000 & Rs. 1,000 <br>
(c) Rs. 3,000 & Rs. 2,000 <br>
(d) Rs. 3,000 & Rs. 5,000

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the cost price of items A and B be A and B respectively.

According to the question, <br>
Profit on A = Loss on B <br>
Or 10% of A = 20% of B <br>
Or (A x 10)/100 = (B x 20)/100 <br>
Or A/B = 2/1 <br>
Or A : B = 2 : 1 <br>

Now with the help of options, check the ratio of C.P. of A and B. Only option (b) renders the above ratio. <br>
Option (b): 2000 : 1000 → 2 : 1

Answer: (b)
