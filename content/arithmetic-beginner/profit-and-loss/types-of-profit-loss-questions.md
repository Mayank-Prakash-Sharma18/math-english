In this article, we are going to have a look at the various kinds of questions formed on Profit and Loss. 

## Type 1: Items buyed at one price and sold at another

### Type 1a

##### Q. Gaurav purchased an article at 4/5th of its marked price and sold it at 20% more than the marked price. What was Gaurav’s profit percent?
<pre>(a) 50%   (b) 40%    (c) 20%   (d) 25%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let marked price = 50 units

For Gaurav, cost price of the article = 4/5th of its marked price = 40 units <br>
Now, Selling price of the article = (50 x 120)/100 = 60 units

So, the required profit percentage = [(60 - 40)/40] x 100 = (20/40) x 100 = 50%

Answer: (a)
</div> <br>

### Type 1b

##### Q. Some items were bought at 8 items for Rs. 5 and sold at 5 items for Rs. 8. What is the profit percentage?
<pre>(a) 108%   (b) 56%    (c) 156%   (d) 68%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the number of items bought = L.C.M. of 8 and 5 = 40. (We will take the LCM of the number of articles)

C.P. of 40 items = (5/8) × 40 = Rs. 25 <br>
S.P. of 40 items = (8/5) × 40 = Rs. 64

So, profit percentage = (39/25) × 100 = 156%

Answer: (c)
</div> <br>

##### Q. Some items were bought at 12 items for Rs. 15 and sold at 10 items for Rs. 14. What is the profit percentage?
<pre>(a) 12%   (b) 18%    (c) 15%   (d) 9%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the number of items bought = L.C.M. of 12 and 10 = 60. (We will take the LCM of the number of articles)

C.P. of 60 items = (60/12) × 15 = Rs. 75 <br>
S.P. of 60 items = (60/10) × 14 = Rs. 84

So, profit percentage = (9/75) × 100 = 12%

Answer: (a)
</div> <br>


##### Q. If cost price of 12 articles is Rs. 15 and the selling price of 8 articles is Rs. 12, then find the profit/loss percent.

<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group22" onclick="openTab('22Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group22', 'tabcontent-group22')">2</button>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group22" onclick="openTab('22Exp-3', this, 'tablink-group22', 'tabcontent-group22')">3</button>

<div id="22Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group22">
Explanation 1: Using Traditional Method <br><br>

C.P. of 12 articles = Rs. 15 <br>
So, C.P. of 1 article = Rs. 15/12 = Rs. 5/4

S.P. of 8 articles = Rs. 12 <br>
So, S.P. of 1 article = Rs. 12/8 = Rs. 3/2

Profit percent = [(S.P. – C.P.) / C.P.] × 100 = [(1/4)/(5/4)] × 100 = 20%
</div>

<div id="22Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group22">
Explanation 2: Using Formula Method<br><br>

To apply the formula, we need to make C.P. = S.P. 

L.C.M (15, 12) = 60

Cost price of 12 articles is Rs. 15 <br>
So, cost price of 48 articles is Rs. 60 

Selling price of 8 articles is Rs. 12 <br>
So, cost price of 40 articles is Rs. 60 

If cost price of 48 articles is equal to the selling price of 40 articles, then  <br>
Profit/loss percent = ((a−b))/b × 100 = ((48−40))/40 × 100 = 8/40 × 100 = 20% 
</div>

<div id="22Exp-3" class="Exp-3 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group22">
Explanation 3: <br><br>

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss1.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:99%;height:99%;">
Profit/loss percent = ((144−120))/120 × 100 = 24/120 × 100 = 20% 
</div><br>

##### Q. A shopkeeper buys some articles at a rate of 9 articles for Rs. 3. If he sells all of them at a rate of 4 articles for Rs. 2, and makes a profit of Rs. 36, then find the number of articles purchased. 

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss2.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:99%;height:99%;">
Profit of 18 – 12 = Rs 6 on 9 articles <br>
So, profit of Rs. 36 will be on (9/6) × 36 = 54 articles
</div> <br>


## Type 2

##### Q. Government announced that if an electricity bill is paid before due date, one gets a concession of 5% on the amount of the bill. By paying a bill before due date, a person got a concession of Rs. 17. What was the original amount of his electricity bill?
<pre>(a) Rs. 325   (b) Rs. 350    (c) Rs. 340   (d) Rs. 334</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the original amount of bill = Rs. x

According to the question, <br>
5% of x = Rs. 17 <br>
Or 5x/100 = 17 <br>
Or x = (17 x 100)/5 = Rs. 340

Answer: (c)
</div> <br>


## Type 3: Profit/Loss in terms of SP

We know that Profit/Loss percentage is calculated on the basis of the Cost Price (CP). However, what if we are given Profit/Loss percentage as compared to the Selling Price (SP)?

Let's see some of such questions. 

##### Q. A person sells an article at a profit which is 25% of the selling price. If the cost price is reduced by 10% and he also reduces the selling price by 10%, then what is the profit percentage on the cost price?
<pre>(a) 30%   (b) 33.33%    (c) 33.67%   (d) 15%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let SP = 40 units <br>
Hence, Profit = 25% of S.P. = 1/4 of S.P. = 10 units <br>
So, C.P. = S.P. – Profit = 40 – 10 = 30 units

As Cost price is reduced by 10%, New CP = (30 x 90)/100 = 27 units <br>
Similarly, Selling price is reduced by 10%, so new SP = (40 x 90)/100 = 36 units <br>
New profit = SP – CP = 36 – 27 = 9 units

So, new profit percentage = (9/27) x 100 = 33.33%

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>


## Type 4: Profit = CP/SP of n items

### Type 4a: Profit = CP of n items

##### Q. By selling 24 litres of juice at Rs. 50 per litre, a merchant earns a profit equivalent to the cost price of 6 litres. What must be his profit percentage?
<pre>(a) 15%   (b) 25%    (c) 20%	   (d) 18%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let cost price per litre of juice be Rs. x <br>
So, cost price of 24 litres of juice = 24x, and profit = 6x 

Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) X 100 = (6x/24x) X 100 = 25%

{{% alert note %}}
The information regarding the price of the juice (Rs. 50 per litre) is redundant, i.e. it's not required to solve the question. You will often be provided with redundant data in quant questions just to confuse you a bit. 
{{% /alert %}}

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>

### Type 4b: Profit = SP of n items

##### Q. A shopkeeper sells 100 pens, and in the process gains the selling price of 40 pens. What is the profit percentage?
(a) 40% <br>
(b) 66.67% <br>
(c) 33.33% <br>
(d) Cannot be determined

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the cost price of one pen = C <br>
And the selling price of one pen = S

As given in the question,
100S – 100C = 40S <br>
Or 60S = 100C <br>
Or S = 5C/3

So, Gain Percent = [(SP - CP)/CP] × 100 % = [(5C/3 - C)/C] × 100% = (2/3) × 100% = 66.67%

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>


## Type 5: SP of n items is equal to CP of m items

If cost price of ‘a’ articles is equal to the selling price of ‘b’ articles, then 
Profit/loss percent = $\frac{a - b}{b}$ × 100

If a > b, it is profit percentage; if a < b, it is loss percentage.

##### Q. If cost price of 20 articles is equal to the selling price of 15 articles, then find the profit/loss percent.

<div id="2Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group2">
Explanation 1: Using Traditional Method <br><br>

Let C.P. of  article = Rs. x <br>
So, C.P. of 20 articles = Rs. 20x

Selling price of 15 articles = Cost price of 20 articles = 20x <br>
So, Selling price of 1 article = Rs. 20x/15 = Rs. 4x/3

Profit percent = [(S.P. – C.P.) / C.P.] × 100 = [(x/3)/x] × 100 = 33.33%
</div>

<div id="2Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group2">
Explanation 2: Using Formula Method<br><br>

If cost price of ‘a’ articles is equal to the selling price of ‘b’ articles, then  <br>
Profit/loss percent = ((a−b))/b × 100 = ((20−15))/15 × 100 = 5/15 × 100 = 33.33% 
</div>

<div id="2Exp-3" class="Exp-3 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group2">
Explanation 3: <br><br>

Let number of articles be 20.

We get the C.P. back by just selling 15 articles. So, 5 articles are left, the S.P. of which is our profit.<br>
So, profit = S.P. of 5 articles AND C.P. = S.P. of 15 articles 

Profit percent = (profit/C.P.) × 100 = (S.P. of 5 articles/S.P. of 15 articles) × 100 = (5/15) × 100 = 33.33%
</div><br>


##### Q. If the selling price of 10 articles is equal to the cost price of 12 articles, then what is the gain percent? 
<pre>(a) 10%   (b) 15%    (c) 11%   (d) 20%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the cost price of each article be Rs. 1 <br>
∴	Cost price of 10 articles = Rs. 10

As we know that the selling price of 10 articles is equal to the cost price of 12 articles. <br>
∴	Selling price of 10 articles = Rs. 12

Now, Profit percent = [(S.P - C.P)/(C.P)] × 100 = (12 - 10)/10 × 100 = 20%.

Answer: (d)
</div> <br>


## Type 6: Mixed and Sold

##### Q. Setu purchased a certain number of articles at Rs. 10 each, and the same number of another articles for Rs. 16 each. He mixed them together and sold them for Rs. 14 each. What is his gain or loss percent?
(a) Loss of 7.69% <br>
(b) Loss of 7.14% <br>
(c) Gain of 7.69% <br>
(d) Gain of 7.14%

Explanations :<br>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1 default-tab" onclick="openTab('1Exp-1', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">1</button>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1" onclick="openTab('1Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">2</button>

<div id="1Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 1: <br><br>

Let us assume that he bought 10 articles of each kind.

∴	Total cost = Rs. (10 × 10 + 16 × 10) = Rs. 260 <br>
Total selling price = Rs. (14 × 20) = Rs. 280

∴	Gain percentage = [(S.P. - C.P.)/(C.P.)] × 100 = [(280 - 260)/260] × 100 = (20/260) × 100 = 7.69%
</div>

<div id="1Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 2: <br><br>

As the number of articles bought are the same in both the cases, the Average C.P. = (10 + 16)/2 = Rs. 13

S.P. = Rs. 14

∴	Gain percentage = [(S.P. - C.P.)/(C.P)] × 100 = [(14 - 13)/(13)] × 100 = (1/13) × 100 = 7.69%
</div><br>


## Type 7: Two items sold (CP is same)

##### Q. Mak buys 2 books for Rs. 600 each, and makes a profit of 15% on one of them and incurs a loss of 15% on the other. What is the overall profit/loss on the entire transaction?
(a) Rs. 36 loss	<br>
(b) Rs. 38 loss <br>
(c) Rs 36 profit <br>	
(d) None of the above

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

SP of the first book = 600 + 15% of 600 = 600 + 90 = Rs. 690 <br>
SP of the second book = 600 - 15% of 600 = 600 - 90 = Rs. 510

Total SP = 690 + 510 = Rs. 1200 <br>
Total CP = 2 x 600 = Rs. 1200

Hence, there is no profit or loss. 

{{% alert note %}}
As the CP or the base is the same, and the profit and loss percent is also the same, so it's obvious that the net profit/loss would be 0. 
{{% /alert %}}

Answer: (d)
</div> <br>


## Type 8: Two items sold (SP is same)

### Concept 1: Finding Ratio of C.P.s

When SP of two articles are same:

(a) First one is sold at a profit of x% and second one is sold at a profit of y%. <br>
Then Ratio of $CP_1$ : $CP_2$ = (100 + y) : (100 + x)

(b) First one is sold at a profit of x% and second one is sold at a loss of y%. <br>
Then, Ratio of $CP_1$ : $CP_2$ = (100 – y) : (100 + x)

(c) First one is sold at a loss of x% and second one is sold at a profit of y%. <br>
Then, Ratio of $CP_1$ : $CP_2$ = (100 + y) : (100 – x)

(d) First one is sold at a loss of x% and second one is sold at a loss of y%. <br>
Then, Ratio of $CP_1$ : $CP_2$ = (100 – y) : (100 – x)

### Concept 2: Finding net profit/loss percentage 

A person sells two objects at the same price, one at a profit/loss of a% and another at a profit/loss of  b%. 

Then, net profit/loss percentage = $\frac{100 (a + b) + 2ab}{200 + a + b}$

{{% alert note %}}
Note: <br>
(a) we use - sign for a, b in case of loss and + sign in case of profit. <br>
(b) If the formula evaluates to a negative value, it means there is a net loss and vice-versa.
{{% /alert %}}

##### Q. Two cars were sold as the same price, one at a profit of 10% and other at a loss of 20%. What must be the ratio of their cost prices? 

Explanations :<br>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group3 default-tab" onclick="openTab('3Exp-1', this, 'tablink-group3', 'tabcontent-group3')">1</button>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group3" onclick="openTab('3Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group3', 'tabcontent-group3')">2</button>

<div id="3Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group3">
Explanation 1: Using Traditional Method <br><br>

Let S.P. of both cars be Rs. x

Then C.P. of first car = [100/(100 + Profit%)] × SP = [100/(100 + 10%)] × x = Rs. 10x/11

And C.P. of second car = [100/(100 - Loss%)] × SP = [100/(100 - 20%)] × x = Rs. 5x/4

Required ratio = (10x/11) : (5x/4) = 8/11, i.e. 8 : 11
</div>

<div id="3Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group3">
Explanation 2: Using Trick Method  <br><br>

When SP of two articles are same: <br>
First one is sold at a profit of x% and second one is sold at a loss of y%. <br>
Then, Ratio of CP1 : CP2 = (100 – y) : (100 + x) = (100 - 20) : (100 + 10) = 80 : 110 = 8:11
</div><br>


##### Q. Mak sells 2 books for Rs. 782 each, thereby making a profit of 15% on one of them and incurring a loss of 15% on the other. What is the overall profit/loss on the entire transaction?
(a) Rs. 36 loss	<br>
(b) Rs. 38 loss <br>
(c) Rs 36 profit <br>	
(d) Rs. 38 profit

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the cost price of the book on which Mak earns profit be Rs. x and that of the book on which he incurs loss be Rs. y.

Thus, 1.15x = 782 and 0.85y = 782 <br>
Solving them, we get: x = 680 and y = 920

Total cost or CP = 680 + 920 = Rs. 1600 <br>
Total SP = 2 x 782 = Rs. 1564

Hence, there is a loss of Rs. (1600 — 1564), i.e. Rs. 36

Answer: (a)
</div> <br>


### Concept 3: Special Case

If SP of two articles are same and one is sold at a profit of x% and another is sold at a loss of x%, then in that case there will always be a loss. 

∴ Loss percentage = $\frac{𝑥^2}{100}$ = ($\frac{x}{10})^2%$

{{% alert note %}}
Note: We can drive this formula using the net profit/loss percentage formula. <br>

Net profit percentage = $\frac{100 (a + b) + 2ab}{200 + a + b}$ = $\frac{100 (x - x) – 2x^2}{200 + x - x}$ = – $\frac{2𝑥^2}{200}$ = – ($\frac{𝑥}{10})^2%$
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert note %}}
If CP of two articles are same and one is sold at a profit of x% and another is sold at a loss of x%, then in that case there will be neither a loss nor any profit.

##### Q. Two shirts were sold as the same price, one at a profit of 10% and other at a loss of 10%. What is the overall gain/loss percentage? 

Explanations :<br>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group4 default-tab" onclick="openTab('4Exp-1', this, 'tablink-group4', 'tabcontent-group4')">1</button>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group4" onclick="openTab('4Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group4', 'tabcontent-group4')">2</button>

<div id="4Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group4">
Explanation 1: Traditional Method <br><br>

Let S.P. of both shirts be Rs. x

Then C.P. of first shirt = $\frac{100}{(100 + Profit \hspace{1ex} Percent)}$ × SP = $\frac{100}{(100 + 10)}$ × x = Rs. $\frac{10x}{11}$ 

And C.P. of second shirt = $\frac{100}{(100 - Loss \hspace{1ex} Percent)}$ × SP = $\frac{100}{(100 - 10)}$ × x = Rs. $\frac{10x}{9}$ 

Total C.P. = $\frac{10x}{11}$ + $\frac{10x}{9}$ = Rs. $\frac{200x}{99}$ 

Total S.P. = Rs. 2x

Loss = $\frac{200x}{99}$ – 2x = Rs. $\frac{2x}{99}$ 

Required loss percent = $\frac{\frac{2x}{99}}{\frac{200x}{99}}$ × 100 = 1%

</div>

<div id="4Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group4">
Explanation 2: Formula Method  <br><br>

If SP of two articles are same and one is sold at a profit of x% and another is sold at a loss of x%, then in that case there will always be a loss. 

∴ Loss percentage = $\frac{𝑥^2}{100}$% = ($\frac{𝑥}{10})^2$% = ($\frac{10}{10})^2$% = 1%

<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group5 default-tab" onclick="openTab('5Exp-1', this, 'tablink-group5', 'tabcontent-group5')">1</button>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group5" onclick="openTab('5Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group5', 'tabcontent-group5')">2</button>

<div id="5Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group5">
Explanation 1: Traditional Method <br><br>

Let C.P. of both shirts be Rs. x

Then S.P. of first shirt = x + 10% of x = Rs. 1.1 x

And S.P. of second shirt = x – 10% of x = Rs. 0.9 x

Total C.P. = Rs, 2x

Total S.P. = 1.1 x + 0.9 x = Rs. 2x

Loss = 2x – 2x = Rs. 0

Required loss percent = $\frac{0}{2x}$ × 100 = 0%

</div>

<div id="5Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group5">
Explanation 2:  <br><br>

Let C.P. of a shirt be Rs. x

In first transaction we get 10% of Rs. x as profit.

In second transaction we get 10% of Rs. x as loss.

Hence, there is neither gain nor loss, in the overall transaction.

</div><br>


### Concept 4: Finding individual C.P., when total C.P. given

A person buys two articles for x. He sells one at a profit of a% and the other at a loss of b%. If each item was sold at the same price, then

C.P. of the article sold in profit = $\frac{x(100 - b)}{200 + a - b}$

C.P. of the article sold in loss = $\frac{x(100 + a)}{200 + a - b}$

<br><hr>


## Type 9: Two items sold (Profit/Loss is same)

##### Q. Two items A and B are sold at a profit of 10% and a loss of 20%, respectively. If the amount of profit and loss is the same, then what may be the cost prices of A and B, respectively?
(a) Rs. 1,500 & Rs. 1,000 <br>
(b) Rs. 2,000 & Rs. 1,000 <br>
(c) Rs. 3,000 & Rs. 2,000 <br>
(d) Rs. 3,000 & Rs. 5,000

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the cost price of items A and B be A and B respectively.

According to the question, <br>
Profit on A = Loss on B <br>
Or 10% of A = 20% of B <br>
Or (A x 10)/100 = (B x 20)/100 <br>
Or A/B = 2/1 <br>
Or A : B = 2 : 1 <br>

Now with the help of options, check the ratio of C.P. of A and B. Only option (b) renders the above ratio. <br>
Option (b): 2000 : 1000 → 2 : 1

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>


## Type 10: Things sold in parts

### Concept 1: Finding overall gain or loss percentage

We already saw how to find overall gain or loss percentage in case there are two items, whose S.P. is the same. 

However, sometimes more items are involved and the S.P. is not necessarily the same. 

Let’s see how to solve such questions. 

##### Q. Some apples are purchased for Rs. 400. One fourth of the apples are sold at a loss of 10% and the remaining at a gain of 20%. What is the overall gain or loss percentage?

Explanation 1: Traditional Method <br><br>

C.P. = Rs. 400

S.P. of one-fourth apples = (1/4) × 400 × (90/100) = Rs. 90

S.P. of the remaining three-fourth apples = (3/4) × 400 × (120/100) = Rs. 360

Total S.P. = 90 + 360 = Rs. 450

So, gain = S.P. – C.P. = 450 – 400 = Rs. 50

Gain percent = (Gain/C.P.) × 100 = (50/400) × 100 = 12.5%

</div>

<div id="6Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group6">
Explanation 2: Alligation Method  <br><br>

Let overall gain/loss percent be x. Some apples are sold at a loss of 10% and the remaining at a gain of 20%.

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss3.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:45%;height:45%;">

(x – 20) : (-10 - x) = (1/4) : (3/4)

Or 3 (x - 20) = -10 – x

Or 3x – 60 = -10 – x

Or x = 12.5% 

So, overall gain percentage = 12.5% 

</div><br>

### Concept 2: Finding total C.P. 

If ‘a’ part of an article is sold at x% profit or loss, ‘b’ part at y% profit or loss and ‘c’ part at z% profit or loss and finally there is a profit or loss of p, 

Then, cost price of entire articles = $\frac{p×100}{(±ax±by±cz)}$

### Concept 3: Finding S.P. of a part so that net gain = 0

If pth part of an item is sold at x% loss, then 

Required gain percent in selling rest of the item in order that there is neither gain nor loss in whole transaction = $\frac{px}{(1−p)}$%

##### Q. One-third of the pencils are sold at a loss of 20%, then at what percent of profit should the rest of them be sold so that there is no overall gain or loss percentage?

Explanation 1: Traditional Method <br><br>

Let C.P. = Rs. 300

S.P. of one- third pencils = (1/3) × 300 × (80/100) = Rs. 80

As there is no overall gain or loss percentage, Total S.P. = Total C.P. = Rs. 300 

So, S.P. of rest of the two- third pencils = 300 – 80 = Rs. 220

So, Gain = S.P. – C.P. = 220 – 200 = Rs. 20

Required Gain percent = (Gain/C.P.) × 100 = (20/200) × 100 = 10%

</div>

<div id="7Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group7">
Explanation 2: Alligation Method  <br><br>

Overall gain/loss percent is 0%. Some pencils are sold at a loss of 20% and let the remaining at a gain of x%.

<img src="../../../media/profit-and-loss/profit-and-loss4.png" alt="profit and loss - trick method" style="width:45%;height:45%;">

(0 – x) : (-20 - 0) = (1/3) : (2/3)

Or -2x = -20

Or x = 10% 

So, required gain percentage = 10% 

</div>

<div id="7Exp-3" class="Exp-3 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group7">
Explanation 3: Formula Method <br><br>

If pth part of an item is sold at x% loss, then 

Required gain percent in selling rest of the item in order that there is neither gain nor loss in whole transaction = $\frac{px}{(1−p)}$% 

Here, p = $\frac{1}{3}$

So, required gain percentage = $\frac{px}{(1−p)}$% = $\frac{(\frac{1}{3})20}{1−(\frac{1}{3})}$% = 10%
