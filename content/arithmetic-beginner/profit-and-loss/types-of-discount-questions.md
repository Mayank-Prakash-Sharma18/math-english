In this article, we are going to have a look at the various kinds of questions formed on Discount. 

## Type 1: Discount percent and Profit/Loss percent given

##### Q. A shopkeeper is selling his goods at 40% discount, but still able to make 20% profit. Marked price is how much percent more than the cost price?
<pre>(a) 60%        (b) 40%          (c) 80%          (d) 100%</pre>

<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1" onclick="openTab('1Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">2</button>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1" onclick="openTab('1Exp-3', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">3</button>

Explanation 1: Using Traditional Method <br><br>

Let cost price be Rs. 100 and mark up percentage be m% <br>
So, price after mark-up = Rs. (100 + m) 

Now, price after 40% discount = (100 + m) × (100 - 40)/100 = Rs. 0.6 (100 + m) 

This is equal to 20% profit over cost price = 100 + 20% of 100 = 100 + 20 = Rs. 120 (because cost price = Rs. 100)

Equating both the terms, we get: <br>
0.6 (100 + m) = 120 <br>
Or m = 100%
</div>

<div id="1Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 2: Using Successive Percentage Formula Method <br><br>

Applying formula of successive percentage increase, we get: <br>
Net increase/decrease percentage = a + b + ab/100

Let a = m% (mark-up) and b = -40% (negative sign because it’s a discount) <br>
We already know that Total profit = 20%

So, (m – 40) - 40m/100 = 20 <br>
Or m = 100%
</div>

<div id="1Exp-3" class="Exp-3 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 3: <br><br>

Let Marked price be Rs. 100

As discount is 40%, so selling price (S.P.) = 100 - 40% of 100 = 100 - 40 = Rs. 60

Now, we know that profit = 20% <br>
So, S.P. = 1.2 C.P. <br>
or 60 = 1.2 C.P. <br>
or C.P. = 60/1.2 = Rs. 50

So, Marked price is 100% more than the Cost price. 
</div><br>


##### Q. A shopkeeper gives 50% discount on the market Price of a product and bears a loss of 40% as a result. If the product is sold at market Price only, then what will be the profit percentage?
<pre>(a) 10%   (b) 20%    (c) 16%   (d) 18.33%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let us assume the market price and cost price of that object to be Rs. 100 and Rs. x respectively. <br>
Selling price of the object after discount = Rs. 50

After offering 50% discount the shopkeeper suffered a loss of 40%. <br>
Loss percentage = [(CP - SP)/CP] × 100 = [(x - 50)/x] × 100 = 40 <br>
or 10x – 500 = 4x <br>
or 6x = 500 <br>
x = 500/6 = Rs. 83.33 

Hence, if sold at the market Price, the profit percentage = [(SP - CP)/CP] × 100 = [(100 - 83.33)/83.33] × 100 = 20%.

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>


##### Q. The marked price and the cost price of a product are in the ratio 5 : 4. The shopkeeper makes a profit even by selling it on a discounted price. The profit percentage and the discount percentage were in the ratio 5 : 4. What is the profit percentage?
<pre>(a) 10%   (b) 16.67%     (c) 15%   (d) 12.5%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the marked price be Rs. 5x, then cost price = Rs. 4x <br>
Similarly, let the profit percentage and the discount percentage be 5y% and 4y% respectively.

Discount is given on the Marked price. <br>
Selling Price = Marked price – Discount = 5x – (4y × 5x)/100 = 5x (1 – 4y/100)   ...(i)

Profit is counted on the Cost price. <br>
Selling price = Cost price + profit = 4x + (5y × 4x)/100 = 4x (1 + 5y/100)   ...(ii)

Equating equations (i) and (ii), we get: <br>
5x (1 – 4y/100) = 4x (1 + 5y/100) <br>
or y = 100/40 = 5/2.

Now, profit percentage = 5y% = 25/2% = 12.5%

Answer: (d)
</div> <br>


## Type 2: Difference between two Discount percentages given

##### Q. While selling a pen, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 6%. If he had given a discount of 8%, he would have got Rs. 12 less as profit. What must be the marked price of the pen?
<pre>(a) Rs. 500   (b) Rs. 600    (c) Rs. 700   (d) Rs. 750</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the marked price of the pen be Rs. p.

Difference of discounts = (8 - 6)% = 2%

2% of p = 12 <br>
or (2/100) p = 12 <br>
or p = (12 × 100)/2 <br>
or p = Rs. 600

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>
