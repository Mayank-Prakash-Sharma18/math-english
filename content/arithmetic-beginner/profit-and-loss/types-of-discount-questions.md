In this article, we are going to have a look at the various kinds of questions formed on Discount. 

## Type 1

##### Q. A shopkeeper is selling his goods at 40% discount, but still able to make 20% profit. Marked price is how much percent more than the cost price?
<pre>(a) 60%        (b) 40%          (c) 80%          (d) 100%</pre>

Explanations :<br>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1 default-tab" onclick="openTab('1Exp-1', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">1</button>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1" onclick="openTab('1Exp-2', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">2</button>
<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1" onclick="openTab('1Exp-3', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">3</button>

<div id="1Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 1: Using Traditional Method <br><br>

Let cost price be Rs. 100 and mark up percentage be m% <br>
So, price after mark-up = Rs. (100 + m) 

Now, price after 40% discount = (100 + m) × (100 - 40)/100 = Rs. 0.6 (100 + m) 

This is equal to 20% profit over cost price = 100 + 20% of 100 = 100 + 20 = Rs. 120 (because cost price = Rs. 100)

Equating both the terms, we get: <br>
0.6 (100 + m) = 120 <br>
Or m = 100%
</div>

<div id="1Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 2: Using Successive Percentage Formula Method <br><br>

Applying formula of successive percentage increase, we get: <br>
Net increase/decrease percentage = a + b + ab/100

Let a = m% (mark-up) and b = -40% (negative sign because it’s a discount) <br>
We already know that Total profit = 20%

So, (m – 40) - 40m/100 = 20 <br>
Or m = 100%
</div>

<div id="1Exp-3" class="Exp-3 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 3: <br><br>

Let Marked price be Rs. 100

As discount is 40%, so selling price (S.P.) = 100 - 40% of 100 = 100 - 40 = Rs. 60

Now, we know that profit = 20% <br>
So, S.P. = 1.2 C.P. <br>
or 60 = 1.2 C.P. <br>
or C.P. = 60/1.2 = Rs. 50

So, Marked price is 100% more than the Cost price. 
</div><br>


## Type 2

##### Q. While selling a pen, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 6%. If he had given a discount of 8%, he would have got Rs. 12 less as profit. What must be the marked price of the pen?
<pre>(a) Rs. 500   (b) Rs. 600    (c) Rs. 700   (d) Rs. 750</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the marked price of the pen be Rs. p.

Difference of discounts = (8 - 6)% = 2%

2% of p = 12 <br>
or (2/100) p = 12 <br>
or p = (12 × 100)/2 <br>
or p = Rs. 600

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>
