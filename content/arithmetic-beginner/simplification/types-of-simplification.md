In this article, we will learn about the various methods to simplify complex looking mathematical expressions. 

## Algebra-based Simplification

Some simplification questions can be solved by directly applying some algebric formulae. We may also use these algebric formulae to find certain powers of numbers, and even ease-out some multiplications for us. 

We recommend you to refer to our Algebra module, and learn the basic algebric formulae from there. Here, we will focus more on the application part.

### Trick 1: $(x + y)^2 \hspace{1ex} and \hspace{1ex} (x – y)^2$

We know that: <br>
$(x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = (x – y)^2 + 4xy$ <br>
$(x – y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 – 2xy$

So, $108^2 = (100 + 8)^2 = 100^2 + 8^2 + (2 × 100 × 8) \hspace{1ex} \hspace{1ex} [as \hspace{1ex} (x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy]$ <br>
= 10000 + 64 + 1600 = 11,664

Similarly, $92^2 = (100 - 8)^2 = 100^2 + 8^2 - (2 × 100 × 8) \hspace{1ex} \hspace{1ex} [as \hspace{1ex} (x - y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy]$ <br>
= 10000 + 64 - 1600 = 8,464

### Trick 2: $x^2 – y^2 = (x + y)(x – y)$

We know that: <br>
$x^2 – y^2 = (x + y)(x – y)$

So, 18 × 22 = (20 - 2) × (20 + 2) = $20^2 - 2^2 \hspace{1ex} \hspace{1ex} [as \hspace{1ex} x^2 – y^2 = (x + y)(x – y)]$ <br>
= 400 - 4 = 396
