## Simple Partnership

Simple partnership - if money is invested for the same time period by various partners in a partnership .

In such a case, the gain or loss is distributed among the partners in the ratio of their investments.

If A and B invest Rs. x and Rs. y respectively for a given period, then at the end of that period: <br>
(A’s share of profit) : (B’s share of profit) = x : y

## Compound Partnership

Compound partnership - if the money is invested for different time periods by various partners in a partnership.

In such a case, the gain or loss is distributed among the partners in the ratio of product of their investments and time periods they invested their money for.

If A invests Rs. x for M years and B invests Rs. y for N years, then: <br>
(A’s share of profit) : (B’s share of profit) = xM : yN

When investments are altered in the given period we need to take it into account while calculating profit-shares. 

***For example:*** <br>
A and B invested Rs. 2000 and Rs. 3000 respectively for a year. If after four months A invested another Rs. 2000, then for the rest of the year A’s investment will be considered as Rs. 4000.

The ratio will come out to be: <br>
A : B :: 40 : 36 <br>
Or A : B :: 10 : 9


##### Q. Aanya invested Rs. 50,000 in a business. After 9 months, Meenakshi joined her with a capital of Rs. 40,000. At the end of the year, what must have been the ratio in which the profit was divided between them? 
<pre>(a) 2 : 5   (b) 5 : 1    (c) 2 : 3   (d) 3 : 4</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Capital of Aanya worked for 12 months and Capital of Meenakshi worked for 3 months. <br>
So, Effective investment of Aanya = Rs. 50,000 × 12 <br>
And Effective investment of Meenakshi = Rs. 40,000 × 3

We know that, Ratio of Profits = Ratio of Effective Investments <br>
So, Ratio of Profits = (50,000 × 12)/(40,000 × 3) = 5/1 <br>
Therefore, the total profit must have been divided between them in the ratio of 5:1.

Answer: (b)

Have a look at the following peculiar example:

Incomes of Mr. A and Mr. B are in the ratio a : b, while their expenditure is in the ratio of x : y. Who saves more, if expenditure cannot exceed the income for either of them?

Let us consider some cases:

Case I: <br>
Incomes of Mr. A and Mr. B are in the ratio 4 : 5, while their expenditure is in the ratio of 3 : 4. <br>
If their incomes are 400 & 500 and expenditures are 30 & 40, then B saves more. <br>
If their incomes are 400 & 500 and expenditures are 330 & 440, then A saves more.

Case II: <br>
Incomes of Mr. A and Mr. B are in the ratio 4 : 5, while their expenditure is in the ratio of 5 : 6. <br>
Here, B will always save more, in all circumstances. 

Can we generalize this?
