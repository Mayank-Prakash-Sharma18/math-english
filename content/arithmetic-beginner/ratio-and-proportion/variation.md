Two quantities may be such that as one quantity changes in value, the other quantity also
changes in value. This variation in value may be:

* Directly Proportional
* Directly Related
* Indirectly Proportional
* Indirectly Related
* A mixture of the above (Joint Variation)

## Direct Variation

It may be of two types: Directly Proportional and Directly Related

### Directly Proportional

One quantity B is directly proportional to another quantity A if their relation is such that if A is increased in a certain ratio, B also increases in the same ratio and if A is decreased in a certain ratio, B also decreases in the same ratio.

<img src="../../../media/ratio/directly-proportional.png" alt="directly proportional" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

E.g. if A becomes three times, B also becomes thrice and if A becomes 2.6 times, B also becomes 2.6 times

Relationship of direct proportion is denoted as B Œ± A (B varies directly as A). <br>

#### Directly Proportional means Ratio is constant

If B Œ± A, then B = kA, where k is a constant (constant of proportionality). <br>
So, B/A = k or the ratio of the two quantities is a constant. <br>
Conversely, when the ratio of two quantities is a constant, we can conclude that they vary directly with each other.

#### Two pairs of directly proportional variables

If B varies directly with A and we have two sets of values of the variables B and A, A1 corresponding to B1 and A2 corresponding to B2, then, since B Œ± A, we can write down: <br>
B1/A1 = B2/A2 <br>
Or B1/B2 = A1/A2

#### Real-life examples of of direct proportion 

A few instances of direct proportion are:

a. Expenditure Œ±  price per unit (if number of units bought is constant) 

b. Amount of work done Œ± Number of men working (rate of work and time for which work done remaining constant)

c. Distance covered Œ± Speed (time remaining constant)

##### Q. The expense on a ride in an adventure park is directly proportional to the number of people riding on it. When 15 people take a ride then expense is Rs. 300. What would be the expense if 45 people take a ride?

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">
Expense Œ± Number of people <br>
So, Expense = k √ó Number of people

We know that, 300 = k √ó 15 <br>
Or k = 20

So, in the second case: <br>
Expense = k √ó 45 = 20 √ó 45 = Rs. 900
</div> <br>

#### Special Cases of direct proportion

A quantity B can also be directly proportional to some power of A. 

That is, B Œ± $A^n$  or B = k $A^n$ 

So, the ratio $\frac{B}{A^n}$ = k (i.e. constant)

##### Q. The height of a boy is in direct proportion to the square root of his age. If at age of 4 years he was 2 feet tall, then what will be his height 12 years later?

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">
Height Œ± ‚àöùê¥ùëîùëí <br>
So, Height = k √ó ‚àöùê¥ùëîùëí

We know that, 2 = k √ó ‚àö4   <br>
Or k = 1

So, in the second case: <br>
Height = k √ó ‚àöùê¥ùëîùëí  = 1 √ó ‚àö(4+12) = ‚àö16 = 4 feet
</div> <br>

### Directly Related

If B is directly related to A (not directly proportional), then as A increases, B also increases but not proportionally.

B = $k_1$ A + $k_2$
(where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are constants.)

In direct proportion the line passes through origin (i.e. when the value of A is zero, B is also zero). <br>
But in the case of direct relation, even though A = 0, B is not zero.

#### Real-life examples of of direct proportion 

Total cost of production = fixed cost + variable cost = fixed cost + (cost per unit √ó number of units produced)

Total cab fare = fixed cost + (fare per km √ó number of kilometers travelled)

Variable cost - Cost per unit (will be incurred only if any unit is produced, e.g. raw material) or Fare per km (will have to be given only if cab moves)
 
Fixed cost - Cost even if no unit is produced (e.g. rent of place, cost of machinery, salaries) or no distance travelled by the cab.

##### Q. There is a ride in an adventure park. When 10 people take a ride then expense is Rs. 300, while when 15 people take a ride then expense is Rs. 400. What would be the expense if 25 people take a ride?

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">
B = $k_1$ A + $k_2$

When 10 people ride: <br>
300 = $k_1$ 10 + $k_2$  ‚Ä¶.. (1) <br>
400 = $k_1$ 15 + $k_2$  ‚Ä¶.. (2)

On solving the two equations, we get: <br>
$k_1$ = 20 and $k_2$ = 100

Expense when 25 people take a ride = $k_1$ 25 + $k_2$ = (20 √ó 25) + 100 = Rs. 600
</div> <br>

## Inverse Variation

It may be of two types: Inversely Proportional and Inversely Related

### Inversely Proportional

One quantity B is inversely proportional to another quantity A if their relation is such that if A is increased in a certain ratio, B gets decreased in the same ratio and if A is decreased in a certain ratio, B also gets increased in the same ratio.

<img src="../../../media/ratio/inversely-proportional.png" alt="inversely proportional" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

#### Inversely Proportional means Product is constant

B being inversely proportional to A is the same as saying that B varies in direct proportion with 1/A. <br>
So, B Œ± 1/A <br>
Or B = k/A, where k is the constant of proportionality. <br>
So, AB = k, a constant

Conversely, if the product of two quantities is a constant, we can conclude that they vary inversely with each other.

#### Two pairs of inversely proportional variables

If B varies inversely with A and we have two sets of values of the variables B and A, A1 corresponding to B1 and A2 corresponding to B2, then, since B Œ± 1/A, we can write down: <br>
A1 B1 = A2 B2 <br>
Or A1/A2 = B2/B1

#### Real-life examples of of inverse proportion 

A few instances of Inverse Proportion are:

a. More the number of people, less is the time needed to complete a given work. 
  
b. Time taken to travel a distance decreases proportionally as speed increases (if distance is constant).

##### Q. If 10 men can build a wall in 20 days, then in how many days will 25 men build it?

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">
AB = k <br>
Or k = 10 √ó 20 = 200

Let the days needed by 25 men be D. The amount of work to be done remains the same. <br>
So, 25 √ó D = 200  <br>
Or D = 200/25 = 8 days
</div> <br>

#### Special Cases of direct proportion

A quantity B can also be inversely proportional to some power of A. 

That is, B Œ± $\frac{1}{A^n}$ <br>
or B $A^n$ = k  (i.e. constant)


### Inversely Related

If B is inversely related to or varies inversely with A (not inversely proportional), then as A increases (or decreases), B decreases (or increase) but not in the same proportion.

B = $\frac{k_1}{A}$ + $k_2$ <br>
(Where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are constants.)


<br> <hr>

## Joint Variation

A variable may be proportional to more than one variables at the same time. 

Let us see a few cases:

### Case 1

If there are three quantities A, B and C such that: <br>
A Œ± B (if C is constant) and  <br>
A Œ± C (if B is constant)

Then, A Œ±  BC   (i.e. A varies jointly with B and C ) <br>
Or A = kBC   (where k is the constant of proportionality)

### Case 2

If there are three quantities A, B and C such that:
A Œ± B and 
A Œ± 1/C

Then, A Œ±  B/C
Or A = kB/C 
Or AC/B = k   (where k is the constant of proportionality)
