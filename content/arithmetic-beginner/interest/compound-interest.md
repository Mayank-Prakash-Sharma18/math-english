## What is Compound Interest (C.I.) ?

* Simple interest (SI) - If interest is accrued on principal.

* Compound interest (CI) - When interest is accrued on principal as well as on interest due for the principal.

***Let's consider an example:***

Mragank borrows Rs. 1,000 @ 10% Interest. <br>
So amount he has to pay back in one year = Principal + SI = 1000 + 10% of 1000 = 1000 + 100 = Rs. 1100 <br>
(interest in the first year is the same both in case of simple interest and compound interest)

In the second year: <br>
If we take the principal amount as Rs. 1000, then this means we are calculating SI. <br>
But if we take the principal amount as Rs. 1100, then this means we are calculating CI (i.e. we are compounding). <br>

With¬†CI¬†we find out the interest for the first period, add it in the total, and¬†then¬†calculate the interest for the next period, and so on (i.e. we pay interest on interest). After a year Mragank owed Rs. 100 interest, which is considered as another loan and interest is charged on it too (i.e. in CI we charge interest on interest earned last year too).  

***Consider another example:***

Rs. 2000 at 10% for 3 years

First year: SI = CI = 20% of 2000 = Rs. 200 <br>
Second year: SI = 200; CI = 200 + 10% of 200 = Rs. 220 <br>
Third year: SI = 200; CI = 200 + 10% of (200 + 220) = 200 + 42 = Rs. 242

So, total SI in 3 years = 200 + 200 + 200 = Rs. 600 <br>
Total CI in 3 years = 200 + 220 + 242 = Rs. 662 <br>

<div class="toc-mak">
<b> Let us generalize this: </b> <br><br>

Let principal P was lent at compound interest of r% p.a.

The interest earned in the first year = r% of P = $\frac{Pr}{100}$   (P is the amount at the start of the first year)

For the second year: <br><br>
Amount outstanding at start of 2nd year = P + $\frac{Pr}{100}$ = P(1 + $\frac{r}{100}$)  <br><br>
Interest earned in the second year = r% of P(1 + $\frac{r}{100}$)  <br><br>
So, Amount after 2 years = P(1 + $\frac{r}{100}$) + r% of P(1 + $\frac{r}{100}$) = P(1 + $\frac{r}{100}$) (1 + $\frac{r}{100}$) = P(1 + $\frac{r}{100})^2$ <br><br>

Similarly, Amount after 3 years = P(1 + $\frac{r}{100})^3$ and so on. 
</div>

Note: So, under compound interest, the amount at the end of the first year will become principal for the second year; the amount at the end of the second year will become the principal for the third year, and so on.

## Compound Interest (C.I.) for uniform rate

### Formula 1

So, if principal = P, rate = r% p.a. and time = n year, and interest is compounded annually, then

Amount at the end of n years = P (1 + $\frac{r}{100})^n$

{{% alert note %}}
Note: This formula is nothing but that of a successive increase of r%. So, Compound Interest is nothing but a case of successive percentage increases.

Compound interest = Amount ‚Äì Principal = = P [(1 + $\frac{r}{100})^n$ ‚àí 1]

##### Q. A sum of Rs. 6000 was borrowed at a rate of 5% per annum compounded annually. What will be the amount to be paid after 2 years?

<button class="mak-tablink tablink-group1" onclick="openTab('1Exp-3', this, 'tablink-group1', 'tabcontent-group1')">3</button>

<div id="1Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 1: Formula Method <br><br>

Amount at the end of n years = P (1 + $\frac{r}{100})^n$ = 6000(1 + $\frac{5}{100})^2$ = 6000 ($\frac{21}{20})^2$ = Rs. 6615 

</div>

<div id="1Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 2: Percentage Method<br><br>

CI for first year = 5% of 6000 = Rs. 300

CI for second year = 5% of (Principal + Interest earned in the first year) = 5% of (6000 + 300) = Rs. 315

So, total CI earned in two years = 300 + 315 = Rs. 615

Hence, amount to be paid after 2 years = Principal + Total CI = 6000 + 615 = Rs. 6615
</div>

<div id="1Exp-3" class="Exp-3 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group1">
Explanation 3: Percentage Method<br><br>

CI = 5%

Effective interest for two years = 5 + 5 + (5√ó5)/100 = 10 + 0.25 = 10.25%

So, Amount = 6000 + 10.25% of 6000 = 6000 + 615 = Rs. 6615
</div><br>


### Formula 2

If interest is compounded annually but time is given in fraction (suppose time = n $\frac{a}{b}$ years), then

Amount = P (1 + $\frac{r}{100})^n$ √ó (1 + $ \frac{ (\frac{a}{b}) r}{100}$)

Explanation 1: Formula Method <br><br>

Amount = P (1 + $\frac{r}{100})^n$ √ó (1 + $ \frac{ (\frac{a}{b}) r}{100}$)

= Amount = 10000 (1 + $\frac{10}{100})^2$ √ó (1 + $ \frac{ (\frac{2}{5}) 10}{100}$)

= 10000 ($\frac{11}{10})^2$ √ó (1 + $\frac{4}{100}$) = 100 √ó $11^2$ √ó ($\frac{26}{25}$) = Rs. 12,584
</div>

<div id="2Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group2">
Explanation 2: Percentage Method  <br><br>

CI for first year = 10% of 10000 = Rs. 1000

CI for second year = 10% of (Principal + Interest earned in the first year) = 10% of (10000 + 1000) = Rs. 1100

CI for next 2/5 years = 10% of (Principal + Interest earned in the first two years) √ó 2/5 = 10% of (10000 + 2100) √ó (2/5) = Rs. 1210 √ó (2/5) = Rs. 484

So, total CI earned in 2$\frac{2}{5}$ years = 1000 + 1100 + 484 = Rs. 2584

Hence, amount to be paid after 2 years = Principal + Total CI = 10000 + 2584 = Rs. 12584

## Compounding Periods (at uniform rate)

Apart from being calculated per year, Compound Interest could also be calculated per month, per day, etc. If it is so, then the question will state that explicitly. 

<div class="toc-mak">
<b>Non-Annual Compounding : </b> <br><br>

If interest is compounded n times per year, then Rate = $\frac{r}{n}$ and Time = nt

Amount = P (1 + $\frac{r}{ùëõ√ó100})^{nùë°}$
</div>

Let us try to understand this formula using various approaches.

### Approach Number 1

If interest is compounded half-yearly, then Rate = $\frac{r}{2}$ and Time = 2n
 
Amount = P (1 + $\frac{r}{2√ó100})^{2n}$  

If interest is compounded quarterly, then Rate = $\frac{r}{4}$  and Time = 4n	

Amount = P (1 + $\frac{r}{4√ó100})^{4n}$  

### Approach Number 2

We can also write the above formula as:

Amount at the end of n years = P (1 + $\frac{r}{100})^{nùë°}$, where

* r - rate of interest per period <br>
The period will be a year if there is annual compounding, 6 months if semi-annual compounding or 1 month if monthly compounding and so on.

* n - the number of time periods.

For example: <br>
If compounding happens every quarter and money is invested at 8% p.a. for 3 years, then <br>
* r = 8/4 = 2% per quarter and  <br>
* n = 3 √ó 4 = 12 quarters.  <br>
(these are the values of r and n that we will use in the CI formula) <br>

Compare the following two cases of money compounded monthly:

* Case 1: If a loan is taken for 12 months at a rate of 2% per month, then r = 2% and n = 12 (12 time-periods of one month each)

* Case 2: If a loan is taken for 12 months at a rate of 24% interest with monthly compounding, then r = 24/12 = 2% and n = 12 (12 time-periods of one month each)

{{% alert note %}}
Note: higher the frequency of compounding, the faster the money grows. 
{{% /alert %}}

### Approach Number 3

If we do not want to use the formula, then we can find the effective rate of interest and then find out the final amount or interest made.

For example:

If rate is 20% per annum, compounded half-yearly, then half-yearly rate, r = 20/2 = 10%

Now, we can either use this in the CI formula  or find the effective rate of annual interest.

Effective rate of annual interest, R = r + r + $\frac{r^2}{100}$ = 10 + 10 + $\frac{10^2}{100}$ = 21%

Amount = Principal + R% of Principal

Choose the method that involves easier calculation.  

##### Q. How much will Rs. 15,000 amount to in 2 years at 8% per annum, if the interest is compounded every 6 months?

<div id="3Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group3">
Explanation 1: Formula Method <br><br>

If interest is compounded half-yearly, then Rate = $\frac{r}{2}$ and Time = 2n
 
Amount = P (1 + $\frac{r}{2√ó100})^{2ùëõ}$ = 15000(1 + $\frac{8}{2√ó100})^{2√ó2}$

= 15000(1 + $\frac{1}{25})^4$ = 15000($\frac{26}{25})^4$

= Rs. 17,548 (approx)

</div>

<div id="3Exp-2" class="Exp-2 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group3">
Explanation 2: Percentage  Method  <br><br>

If interest is compounded half-yearly, then half-yearly rate = 8/2 = 4% <br>
Effective rate of annual interest for 1 year = x + y + $\frac{xy}{100}$ = 4 + 4 + 16/100 = 8.16% <br>
Effective rate of annual interest for 2 years = x + y + $\frac{xy}{100}$ = 8.16 + 8.16 + (8.16)(8.16)/100 = 16.99% (i.e. around 17%) <br>

So, Amount = P + 17% of P = 15000 + 17% of 15000 = 15000 + 2550 = Rs. 17,550 (approx)

<div id="6Exp-1" class="Exp-1 mak-tabcontent tabcontent-group6">
Explanation 1: Formula Method <br><br>

Let the number of years be n.

Amount payable, 2P = P $[1 + (50/200)]^{2n}$ <br>

or $(1.25)^{2n}$ = 2

The approximate value of 2n that satisfies the above equation is 3. <br>

Explanation 2: Using the Options  <br><br>

Let us assume that simple interest is payable. Even under S.I. at the rate of 50%, the amount will double in 2 years.

## Compound Interest (C.I.) for varying rates 

If rates of interest are $r_1$%, $r_2$% and $r_3$% for $1^{st}$, $2^{nd}$ and $3^{rd}$ year respectively, then

Amount = P (1 + $\frac{r_1}{100}$) (1 + $\frac{r_2}{100}$) (1 + $\frac{r_3}{100}$)

## Money becomes n times (in case of CI)

### Formula 1

<div class="toc-mak"> <br>
A certain sum of money becomes ‚Äòk‚Äô times in¬†n¬†years. <br> <br>

The rate of compound interest, r = 100 [($\frac{A}{P})^{\frac{1}{n}}$¬†‚Äì 1] = 100($k^\frac{1}{n}$¬†‚Äì 1)
</div>

We can also reframe this formula as follows:

If certain sum of money amounts to  ‚Äò$A_1$‚Äô in¬†$n_1$¬†years and to ‚Äò$A_2$‚Äô in¬†$n_2$¬†years. 

Then, k = $A_2$ / $A_1$  and time, n = ($n_2$ - $n_1$) years

The rate of compound interest, r = 100 [($\frac{A_2}{A_1})^{\frac{1}{(n_2 - n_1)}}$¬†‚Äì 1]

#### Shortcut Method:

The number of years taken for an amount to double at CI @ r% p.a. is

* 72/r years. (we will  get approximate answer)

* (69/r) + 0.35 (this will give even more accurate answer)

##### Q. What are the least number of years in which a sum of money will become 1.21 times itself at a compound rate of 10%? 

Explanation: Formula Method<br>
<div class="Exp">
Amount = P (1 + $\frac{r}{100})^n$ <br><br>
Or 1.21 P = P (1 + $\frac{10}{100})^n$ <br><br>
Or ($\frac{11}{10})^n$ = 1.21 <br><br>

So, n = 2 years
</div> <br>

##### Q. What are the least number of years in which a sum of money will become 2 times itself at a compound rate of 10%? 

Explanation: Short Trick Method<br>
<div class="Exp">
The number of years taken for an amount to double at CI @ r% p.a. = 72/r = 72/10 = 7.2 years

OR

The number of years taken for an amount to double at CI @ r% p.a. = (69/r) + 0.35 = (69/10) + 0.35 = 6.9 + 0.35 = 7.25 years
</div> <br>

### Formula 2

If a certain sum at compound interest becomes $k_1$ times in $n_1$ years and $k_2$ times in $n_2$ years, then

$k_1^{\frac{1}{n_1}}$ = $k_2^{\frac{1}{n_2}}$

Or $k_1^{n_2}$ = $k_2^{n_1}$

If a certain sum becomes¬†k¬†times in¬†n¬†years at compound interest, then the same sum becomes¬†$k^m$¬†times in¬†mn¬†years.

For example, if a sum becomes 2 times in 3 years, then the same sum will become $2^4$ (=16) times in 4√ó3 = 12 years
