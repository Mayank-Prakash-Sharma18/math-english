In this article, we are going to have a look at the various kinds of questions formed on Simple Interest. 

## Type 1

##### Q. Rohan invested a sum of money in a simple interest bond. The money grew to Rs. 4000 in 3 years and to Rs. 5600 in 7 years. What was the rate of interest?
<pre>(a) 12.36%   (b) 14.28%    (c) 15%   (d) 17.68%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let the principal amount be Rs. X

Interest earned in 3 years = Amount at the end of 3 years – principal amount = 4000 – X

Interest earned = principal amount × interest rate × time in years <br>
or 4000 – X = X × interest rate × 3 <br>
or Interest rate = (4000 – X) /(3X)

Interest earned in 7 years = Amount at the end of 7 years – principal amount = 5600 – X

Interest earned = principal amount × interest rate × time in years <br>
or 5600 – X = X × interest rate × 7 <br>
or Interest rate = (5600 – X) /(7X)

But interest rate is the same in both the cases. So we can equate two equations to get the value of X
i.e. (4000 – X) / (3X) = (5600 – X) / (7X) <br>
or 28000 – 7X = 16800 – 3X <br>
or X = Rs. 2,800

Interest rate (%) = [(5600 – X) /(7X)] × 100 = 100 / 7 = 14.28 %

Answer: (b)

## Type 2

##### Q. Nicole invests a certain amount of money for two years at simple interest. He gets a total of Rs. 2,400 at the end of two years when annual rate of interest is 10%. What should be the rate of interest to get a total sum of Rs. 3,200 at the end of two years?
<pre>(a) 20%   (b) 30%    (c) 24%   (d) 32%</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let principle be Rs. P <br>
Simple Interest = Total Amount – Principle = 2400 – P

Now, Simple Interest = (P × r × t)/100 <br>
Or 2400 - P = (P × 10 × 2)/100 <br>
Or P = Rs. 2,000

If the total amount = Rs. 3,200, then Simple interest = 3200 – 2000 = Rs. 1,200

Now, Simple Interest = (P × r × t)/100 <br>
Or 1200 = (2000 × r × 2)/100 <br>
Or r = 30%

Answer: (b)
