CI formulae can be applied to phenomenon of population, price change etc.

## Population

If the population of a city is P and it increases with the rate of r% per annum, then

(i)	Population after n years = P (1 + $\frac{r}{100})^n$

(ii)	Population n years ago = $\frac{P}{(1 + \frac{r}{100})^n}$

(iii)	If the rate of growth per year is $r_1$%, $r_2$%, $r_3$%,.........$r_n$%, then
Population after n years =  P (1 + $\frac{r_1}{100}$) (1 + $\frac{r_2}{100}$) (1 + $\frac{r_3}{100}$)......(1 + $\frac{r_n}{100}$)

(This formula can also be used, if there is increase/decrease in the price of an article).

{{% alert note %}}
Note : If population decreases with the rate of r%, then (–) sign will be used in place of (+) in the above mentioned formula.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert note %}}
In questions involving population growth or appreciation/depreciation of assets, we will assume  Compound Interest (unless stated otherwise). 

In all other cases (e.g. bank loans), if nothing is mentioned, we will assume Simple Interest.

##### Q. Aedes Aegypti mosquitos are responsible for the spread of dengue. A colony of 25,000 such mosquitos increase at a rate of 10% of its population per hour. What will be the count of mosquitos after three hours?
<pre>(a) 33,275   (b) 33,175    (c) 27,000   (d) 27,335</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Suppose that original population = P, Rate of population rise = r%, and Time = n periods

The given population will rise at a compounded rate, as the new mosquitos will keep adding on to the population growth.

Then the final population after n time periods = P $[1 + (r/100)]^n$

So, the population after three hours = 25000 $[1 + (10/100)]^3$ = 25000 $(11/10)^3$ = 25000 × $(1.1)^3$ = 25000 × 1.331 = 33,275

Answer: (a)
