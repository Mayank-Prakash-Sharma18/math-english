CI formulae can be applied to phenomenon of population, price change etc.

## Population

If the population of a city is P and it increases with the rate of r% per annum, then

(i)	Population after n years = P (1 + $\frac{r}{100})^n$

(ii)	Population n years ago = $\frac{P}{(1 + \frac{r}{100})^n}$

(iii)	If the rate of growth per year is $r_1$%, $r_2$%, $r_3$%,.........$r_n$%, then
Population after n years =  P (1 + $\frac{r_1}{100}$) (1 + $\frac{r_2}{100}$) (1 + $\frac{r_3}{100}$)......(1 + $\frac{r_n}{100}$)

(This formula can also be used, if there is increase/decrease in the price of an article).

Note : If population decreases with the rate of r%, then (â€“) sign will be used in place of (+) in the above mentioned formula.

In questions involving population growth or appreciation/depreciation of assets, we will assume  Compound Interest (unless stated otherwise). 

In all other cases (e.g. bank loans), if nothing is mentioned, we will assume Simple Interest.
