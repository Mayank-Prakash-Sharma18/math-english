## What is a Fraction?

Fraction is any number which can be expressed in the form $\frac{p}{q}$. <br>
(where p and q are natural numbers and q is non-zero). 

E.g. $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{3}{4}$, $\frac{11}{12}$ etc.

A fraction denotes a part or parts of a unit. 

## Types of fractions

* Proper Fractions: The fractions where the numerator is less than the denominator. So, obviously such fractions are always less than 1. <br>
E.g. $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{3}{4}$, $\frac{99}{100}$ etc.

* Improper Fraction:  The fractions where the numerator is more than the denominator. They are greater than 1. <br>
E.g. $\frac{3}{2}$, $\frac{5}{3}$, $\frac{101}{100}$ etc.

* Mixed Fraction: They have two parts, an integer part and a fractional part. All mixed fractions are improper fractions, i.e. we can convert a mixed fraction into an improper fraction and vice-versa. <br>
E.g. 3$\frac{1}{2}$ = $\frac{7}{2}$ etc. 

* Compound Fraction : Fractions whose numerator and denominator themselves are fractions.

## Comparison of Fractions

### Fractions with same denominators

If the fractions to be compared have the same denominator, then our task is simplified. We just need to compare the numerators. Bigger the numerator, bigger the fraction.

##### Q. Which of these fractions is greater? <br>
2/5 and 4/5

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

These two fractions have the same denominator. So, the fraction with the bigger numerator will be the bigger fraction.

As, 4 > 2 <br>
So, 4/5 > 2/5 
</div> <br>

### Fractions with same numerators

If the fractions to be compared have the same numerator, then our task is simple. We just need to compare the denominators. Bigger the denominator, smaller the fraction.

##### Q. Which of these fractions is greater? <br>
3/5 and 3/7

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

These two fractions have the same numerator. So, the fraction with the bigger denominator will be the smaller fraction.

As, 7 > 5 <br>
So, 3/5 > 3/7 
</div> <br>
