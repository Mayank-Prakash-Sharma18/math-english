In this article, we will try to cover all the types of aptitude questions that are framed on the concepts of Number System. 

## Type 1

##### Q. Two statements S1 and S2 are given below followed by a question.

S1: $(a + b)^2 < (a - b)^2$ <br>
S2: a = b

Is ab positive?

(a) S1 alone is sufficient to answer the Question. <br>
(b) S2 alone is sufficient to answer the Question. <br>
(c) S1 and S2 together are sufficient to answer the Question, but neither S1 alone nor S2 alone is sufficient to answer the Question. <br>
(d) Either S1 alone or S2 alone is sufficient to answer the Question.

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Evaluating Statement 1: <br>
$(a + b)^2 < (a - b)^2$ <br>
Expanding both sides of the inequality, we get $a^2 + b^2 + 2ab < a^2 + b^2 - 2ab$ <br>
Simplifying we get, 4ab < 0 or ab < 0. <br>
So, we can conclude that ab is not positive. <br>
Thus, Statement 1 ALONE is sufficient.

Evaluating Statement 2: <br>
a = b <br>
Product of two positive numbers or two negative numbers will be always positive. But if both a and b are equal to zero, then ab will be zero too, which is not a positive number. <br>
Thus, Statement 2 ALONE is not sufficient.

Answer: (a)

## Type 2

##### Q. Two statements S1 and S2 are given below followed by a question.

S1: Sum of the digits is even. <br>
S2: The number, when multiplied by 2, fetches an even number.

Is the two-digit number odd?

(a) S1 alone is sufficient to answer the Question. <br>
(b) S2 alone is sufficient to answer the Question. <br>
(c) S1 and S2 together are sufficient to answer the Question, but neither S1 alone nor S2 alone is sufficient to answer the Question. <br>
(d) S1 and S2 together are not sufficient to answer the Question.

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

The two-digit odd number means unit digit contains 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.

Statement 1: <br>
If the sum of digits is even, then both the digits are odd, such as 33, 31, 75, 77, 99, etc. <br>
Or both the digits are even, such as 24, 46, 64, etc. <br>
So, Statement 1 alone is not sufficient

Statement 2: <br>
When even number or odd number is multiplied by 2, then we always get an even number. <br>
So, Statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

Even by using both statements together, we do not get to know whether the number is even or odd. <br>
âˆ´ S1 and S2 together are not sufficient to answer the Question.

Answer: (d)
</div> <br>

## Type 3

##### Q. Two statements S1 and S2 are given below followed by a question.

S1: x > 0 <br>
S2: x < 1

Is $x^3 > x^2$?

(a) S1 alone is sufficient to answer the Question. <br>
(b) S2 alone is sufficient to answer the Question. <br>
(c) S1 and S2 together are sufficient to answer the Question, but neither S1 alone nor S2 alone is sufficient to answer the Question. <br>
(d) S1 and S2 together are not sufficient to answer the Question.

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Statement 1: x > 0 <br>
We know that x is a positive number. 

Interval 1: If 0 < x < 1, then $x^3 < x^2$ <br>
For example, $(0.5)^3$ = 0.125, $(0.6)^2$ = 0.36 

Interval 2: If x > 1, then $x^3 > x^2$ <br>
For example, $4^3$ = 64, $4^2$ = 16 <br>
We do NOT have a DEFINITE answer using statement 1. So, Statement 1 ALONE is NOT sufficient.

Statement 2: x < 1 <br>
Interval 1: For positive values of x, i.e., 0 < x < 1, we know that $x^3 < x^2$ <br>
Interval 2: For negative values of x, $x^3$ will be a negative number and $x^2$ will be a positive number. <br>
Hence, $x^3 < x^2$

Lastly, what about x = 0? <br>
When x = 0, $x^3 = x^2$ <br>
Hence, if we know that x < 1, then we can conclude that $x^3$ is NOT GREATER THAN $x^2$. <br>
We have a DEFINITE answer.<br>
Statement 2 ALONE is sufficient. 

Answer: (b)
