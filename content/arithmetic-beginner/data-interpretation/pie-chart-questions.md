If it is given that power constitutes 50% of the other costs and the power cost declines by 10%, then by what percentage will the total expenses of the company decrease? <br>
(a) 2.5% <br>
(b) 5% <br>
(c) 10% <br>
(d) Cannot be determined.

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Assume that the total expense of the company = Rs. 100. <br>
Then, Other costs = Rs. 50

Now, Power cost = 50% of the other costs = 50% of 50 = Rs. 25. <br>
Decrease in power cost = 10% of original rate = 10% of 25 = Rs. 2.5.

Hence, the percentage decrease in expenses = (2.5/100) Ã— 100 = 2.5%.

Answer: (a)
