In this article, we are going to have a look at the various kinds of Line chart DI sets. 

## Type 1: Line Chart Comprehension

This is one of the most beautiful type of line chart sets. You need not do much calculation (sometimes no calculation at all!). All you have to do is ***think***, understand what the graph is telling you, comprehend it. 

Let's see a few examples. 

##### Q. A Tiger stalks his prey, moves slowly, stopping occasionally and finally making a dash towards the prey. If the distance travelled by the Tiger during this pursuit is represented along the Y axis, then which of the following graphs best represents the movements of the tiger while catching his prey?
(a) <img src="../../../media/di/line-chart-question-4.png" alt="Line Chart Questions" style="width:45%;height:45%;">   
(b) <img src="../../../media/di/line-chart-question-5.png" alt="Line Chart Questions" style="width:45%;height:45%;">    
(c) <img src="../../../media/di/line-chart-question-6.png" alt="Line Chart Questions" style="width:45%;height:45%;">   
(d) <img src="../../../media/di/line-chart-question-7.png" alt="Line Chart Questions" style="width:45%;height:45%;">

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Answer: (a)

Option (b) can be rejected straightaway, as it shows that the Tiger travels some distance in zero time duration (represented by the vertical lines). It means that the Tiger has infinite speed, which is not possible. 

Option (c) is also wrong as it shows a decrease in distance with time which is not possible.
According to the question, the tiger stops occasionally during his pursuit of the prey. The only two graphs representing this are given in option (a) and option (d). 

Out of option (a) and option (d), option (a) is correct as it shows a rapid increase in speed of the Tiger at the end (according to the question, the Tiger makes a dash towards the prey in the end). Whereas in option (d), the tiger moves slower in the end than his earlier speeds.

##### Q. Consider the information given below and answer the 3 (three) items that follow.

Following graph depicts a 20 km race between a Rabbit and a Tortoise.
<img src="../../../media/di/line-chart-question-1.png" alt="Line Chart Questions" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

Q1. How many times did the rabbit take rest during the race? <br>
(a) 2	<br>
(b) 3 <br>
(c) 4	<br>	
(d) 6 <br>

Q2. After starting the race from the same point, how many times did the Rabbit overtake the Tortoise during the race? <br>
(a) 2	<br>
(b) 3 <br>
(c) 4	<br>		
(d) 5 <br>

Q3.	After how much time since the start of the race did the Tortoise overtake the Rabbit for the first time? <br>
(a) 21 hours <br>		
(b) 29 hours <br>
(c) 35 hours <br>
(d) 14 hours <br>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Answer 1:	(b)

The horizontal lines in the graph depict the time-duration during which the Rabbit was at rest, as distance is not increasing with time. Thus, it’s evident that he took rest 3 times.

Answer 2:	(a)

The Rabbit overtook Tortoise two times as shown in the graph given below. 
<img src="../../../media/di/line-chart-question-2.png" alt="Line Chart Questions" style="width:72%;height:72%;">
These are the instances on which the line graph of Rabbit moves above that of the Tortoise, i.e. when the total distance travelled by the Rabbit becomes more than that travelled by the Tortoise.

Answer 3:	(a)

The Tortoise overtook the Rabbit for the first time at point A as shown in the graph given below.
<img src="../../../media/di/line-chart-question-3.png" alt="Line Chart Questions" style="width:72%;height:72%;">
This happens at approximately 21 hours since the start of the race. Hence, option (a) is the correct answer. <br>
In fact we may straightaway eliminate options (c) and (d), as they fall outside the 15-30 hours range, while point A is definitely within this range.

##### Q. Observe the following graph carefully, and answer the 2 (two) items that follow:

<img src="../../../media/di/line-chart-question-8.png" alt="Line Chart Questions" style="width:72%;height:72%;">
The line graph shown above depicts the number of students in a university across various years.

Q1.	Which region of the curve corresponds to the region of maximum growth in the number of students in the university?
<pre>(a) B   (b) C    (c) D   (d) E</pre>

Q2.	Which region of the curve may be representing the initiation of a decline in the popularity of the university, based on the parameter of the number of students enrolled in the university? 
<pre>(a) C   (b) E    (c) F   (d) D</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Answer 1: (a)

Observing the figure we can easily conclude that A, B and C zones are definitely among the zones of high growth rate (of the number of students in the University).

Zone A may be rejected as here the growth rate has just started picking up. <br>
More specifically, the growth rate in zone A = [(300 - 200)/200] × 100 = 50% (approximately)

While, zone C may be rejected as here the growth rate has started falling down. <br>
The growth rate in zone C = [(900 - 800)/800] × 100 = 12.5% (approximately)

However, the growth rate in zone B = [(800 - 300)/300] × 100 = 166.67% (approximately) <br>
Therefore, B zone is the region of maximum growth rate in the number of students, in the given graph.

Answer 2: (d)

The curve started declining in the D zone, which reflects the fact that the number of students in the university started falling during this time.
