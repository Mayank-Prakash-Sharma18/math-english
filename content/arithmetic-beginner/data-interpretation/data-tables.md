<pre>(a) 47%   (b) 39%    (c) 49%   (d) 53%</pre>

Q2. What is the average amount of taxes that Mr. X had to pay over the period of given five years?
<pre>(a) Rs. 8,800   (b) Rs. 9,800    (c) Rs. 10,000   (d) Rs. 9,500</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Answer 1: (c)

Total expenditure on fuel, transport and housing = 15 + 20 + 23 + 20 + 22 = 100 thousand <br>
Total expenditure on taxes = 49 thousand

Thus, the required percentage = (49/100) × 100 = 49%.

Answer 2: (b)

As average is asked we have to add total taxes paid by Mr. X and divide it by the number of years.

Total taxes paid= 8 + 11 + 8 + 12 + 10 = Rs. 49 thousand <br>
Number of years = 5

Average amount of taxes = 49/5 = Rs. 9.8 thousand = Rs. 9,800
