## What is bar graph?

Just like a Line chart, a Bar graph also represents the trend and correlation among the variables on the X and the Y axis. The bar graph may be vertical as shown below or horizontal. Moreover, there may be many other variations possible.

In a vertical bar graph, the X-axis generally represents a discrete variable, e.g. company name, year etc. The height of the bar may represent the value or frequency. 

Bar graph also allows us to draw comparisons within the represented discreet variable, e.g. how has been the performance of school A in the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.
