We will encounter four types of statements (as premises and conclusions).

* Universal Affirmative - i.e. affirmative declarative sentence with universal quantifier.
* Universal Negative - i.e. negative declarative sentence with universal quantifier.
* Particular Affirmative - i.e. affirmative declarative sentence with particular quantifier.
* Particular Negative - i.e. negative declarative sentence with particular quantifier.

Let's see them one by one and how they are represented through Venn diagram.

## Universal Affirmative

All S are P - We can showcase it using two possible Venn Diagrams.

All positive propositions beginning with 'every', 'each' and 'any' etc are of this type. <br>
e.g., Every cot is mat. (All cots are mats) <br>
Each student of class V has passed. (All students of class V have passed) <br>
Anyone can do this job. (All can do this job) <br>

## Universal Negative

No S is P – We can showcase it using only one possible Venn Diagram
<img src="../../../media/syllogism/syllogism1.png" alt="syllogism" style="width:72%;height:72%;">
All negative sentences beginning with 'no one', 'none', 'not a single' etc are of this type. <br>
e.g., Not a single student could pass the exam. <br>
None can cross the English channel. <br>

## Particular Affirmative

Some S are P – We can showcase it using four possible Venn Diagrams. (It is opposite to No S are P)

The most common way to represent this are:

But 'Some S are P' also includes the possibility that 'All S are P' (so we can draw the two diagrams of Universal Affirmative here too).
<img src="../../../media/syllogism/syllogism.png" alt="syllogism" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

Positive propositions beginning with words such as 'most', 'a few', 'mostly', 'generally', 'almost', 'frequently' and 'often' etc are of this type. <br>
e.g., Almost all the laptops have been sold (Some laptops have been sold.) <br>
Most of the aspirants will qualify in the examination (Some of the aspirants will qualify in the examination.) <br>

## Particular Negative

Some S are not P – We can showcase it using three possible Venn Diagrams.

The most common way to represent this are:
<img src="../../../media/syllogism/syllogism3.png" alt="syllogism" style="width:90%;height:90%;">

But 'Some S are not P' also includes the possibility that 'No S is P' (so we can draw the one diagram of Universal Negative here too).
