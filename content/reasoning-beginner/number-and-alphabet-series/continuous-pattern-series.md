Continuous pattern series generally consists of small letters of English alphabet where the letters are arranged following a certain pattern. 

The candidate is required to identify the pattern and accordingly find the missing letters from the given alternatives.

## How to approach Continuous pattern series questions?

* Read the series and see if any pattern is evident. Sometimes ***reading a series quickly*** may do the trick.

* ***Counting the number of elements*** in the given series may give a clue of the length of the group of letters being repeated, i.e. 3, 4 or 5 etc. 

* If no pattern is evident then ***make use of the options smartly***. Ideally this may be done in the second round of the paper being attempted so as to avoid getting stuck.

## How to smartly make use of the options in Continuous pattern series questions?

Let us consider an example…

##### Q. Find the missing letters in the following series: <br>
_a_aaaba_ _ba_ab_
<pre>(a) aababa  (b) abaaaa  (c) abaaba  (d) ababaa</pre>
<pre>(SSC Question)</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

No pattern is visible in the series as such.

So, let's count the number of terms/elements in the series. <br>
Number of elements = 16 <br>
So, repeated group is probably 4 elements long. <br>

Hence, we will make use of the options. Let’s see ... 

* The first letter in all the options is 'a'. So, the first missing letter in the given series must be ‘a’.

* The last letter in all the options is 'a'. So, the last missing letter in the given series must be ‘a’.

Hence, the given series effectively becomes: <br>
aa_aaaba_ _ba_aba

Now, we can see that the given series is a repetition of ‘aaba’. It has been represented in the diagram given below:

## Types of Continuous pattern series

Let us consider a few cases ...

### Type 1: Repetition of same group in same form 

These questions are the easiest and the most common of Continuous pattern series questions. 

##### Q. Find the missing letters in the following series: <br>
m _ m _ am _ a _
<pre>(a) mama  (b) amaa  (c) ammm  (d) amam</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Number of elements = 9 <br>
So repeated group is probably 3 elements long. 

Now, we can see that the given series is a repetition of ‘mam’. It has been represented in the diagram given below:
<img src="../../../media/series/continuous-pattern-series1.png" alt="Continuous pattern series" style="width:54%;height:54%;">

Answer: (c)
</div> <br>

### Type 2: Repetition of two groups in same form 

##### Q. Find the missing letters in the following series: <br>
l_n_mllm_n_l
<pre>(a) mnmm  (b) nmmm  (c) mnmn  (d) mnnm</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Number of elements = 12 <br>
So repeated groups are probably 3 or 4 elements long. 

The given series has been represented in the diagram given below:
<img src="../../../media/series/continuous-pattern-series2.png" alt="Continuous pattern series" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

Answer: (d)
</div> <br>

### Type 3: Cyclic Series   

##### Q. Find the missing letters in the following series: <br>
_ ab _ b _ bc _ ca _
<pre>(a) abacb  (b) cacab  (c) accbb  (d) abcca</pre>
<pre>(SSC Question)</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Number of elements = 12 <br>
So repeated groups are probably 3 or 4 elements long.  

The given series has been represented in the diagram given below:
<img src="../../../media/series/continuous-pattern-series3.png" alt="Continuous pattern series" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

You can see that the elements are moving in a cyclic fashion; in clockwise direction to be precise. 

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>

### Type 4: Swap Series   

##### Q. Find the missing letters in the following series: <br>
_ cb _ ca _ bacb _ ca _ bac_ d
<pre>(a) addddb   (b) addbbb  (c) bbbddd  (d) badddb</pre>
<pre>(SSC Question)</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Number of elements = 20 <br>
So repeated groups are probably 4 or 5 elements long.  

The given series has been represented in the diagram given below:
<img src="../../../media/series/continuous-pattern-series4.png" alt="Continuous pattern series" style="width:81%;height:81%;">

You can see that the elements are constantly swapping their places in pairs. 

{{% alert note %}}
This series may also be considered as 'Repetition of two groups in same form', i.e. 'acbd' and 'cadb'.
{{% /alert %}}

Answer: (a)
</div> <br>

### Type 5: Increasing/Decreasing Series     

##### Q. Find the missing letters in the following series: <br>
ZX_TR_NLJ_F
<pre>(a) VRH   (b) UPJ  (c) VPH  (d) UPJ</pre>
<pre>(SSC Question)</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Number of elements = 11 <br>
We can tell by looking at the given series that it’s continuously decreasing (when seen from left to right). 

The given series has been represented in the diagram given below:
