## What is number series?

It is a sequence of numbers that follow a particular pattern, i.e. there is an underlying logic/rule that all elements of that series have to follow. 

For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ..... (each subsequent number in this series is 1 more than the previous number)

You will be much more comfortable in solving such questions, if you acclimatize yourself with numbers. You should know the following to be good in this chapter:
* Squares till 32
* Cubes till 12
* Few concepts of Number System – even/odd, prime numbers etc. 
* Few other miscellaneous concepts like Roman Numbers, Fibonacci series etc.

There are two broad categories of questions that are asked in number series:
* Find the missing number in the series
* Find the wrong number in the series

Let's study them, one by one. 


## Finding Missing Number in the Number series

Different logics are used to formulate such questions. We should be familiar will most of them, so that we may be able to recognize them in the exam time. 

### Type 1: Same Number is added/subtracted 

In this type of series, the difference between two consecutive numbers is the same.

For example, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ?  <br>
Each subsequent number in this series is 2 more than the previous number. So, we are adding 2 to get the next number in the series.

Series which looks addition type in one direction will look subtraction type in reverse direction and vice-versa. 

For example, in the previous series: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ? <br>
If we move from right to left, then we can say that each subsequent number in this series is 2 less than the previous number. So, we are subtracting 2 to get the next number in the series.

##### Q. Find the missing number in the following series: <br>
0.5, 2, 3.5, 5, 6.5, 8, ?
<pre>(a) 9.5        (b) 10.5          (c) 9.0          (d) 11.0</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Pattern: <br>
0.5 + 1.5 = 2 <br>
2 + 1.5 = 3.5 <br>
3.5 + 1.5 = 5 <br>
5 + 1.5 = 6.5 <br>
6.5 + 1.5 = 8 <br>
8 + 1.5 = ***9.5*** <br>
Next element = Previous element + 1.5 

Answer: (a)
</div> <br>


##### Q. Find the missing number in the following series: <br>
110, 107, 104, ?, 98, 95  
<pre>(a) 102        (b) 105          (c) 100          (d) 101</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Rule: <br>
Next element = Previous element - 3 <br>
So, missing number = ***101*** <br>

Answer: (d)
</div> <br>

Sometimes, you may be given numbers in some other form, e.g. Roman numbers. So, you must have familiarity with them. 

##### Q. Find the missing number in the following series: <br>
II, V, VIII, XI, XIV, ?, XX
<pre>(a) XVI        (b) XVII          (c) XV          (d) XIX</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Pattern: <br>
II + 3 = V <br>
V + 3 = VIII <br>
VIII + 3 = XI <br>
XI + 3 = XIV <br>
XIV + 3 = ***XVII*** <br>
XVII + 3 = XX <br>
(i.e. Next element = Previous element + 3)

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>

Sometimes, couple of numbers may be added/subtracted in alternate fashion. 

##### Q. Find the missing number in the following series: <br>
30, 28, 23, 21, ?  
<pre>(a) 17        (b) 16          (c) 19          (d) 15</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Pattern: <br>
30 - 2 = 28 <br>
28 - 5 = 23 <br>
23 - 2 = 21 <br>
21 - 5 = ***16*** <br>

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>

### Type 2: Number added/subtracted is constantly increased/decreased

In this type of series, number added or subtracted to each term is in increasing or decreasing order.

##### Q. Find the missing number in the following series: <br>
3, 5, 8, 12, 17, ?
<pre>(a) 25        (b) 23          (c) 19          (d) 21</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

In the given ascending series, the difference between two consecutive numbers is in increasing order i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively.

Pattern: <br>
3 + 2 = 5 <br>
5 + 3 = 8 <br>
8 + 4 = 12 <br>
12 + 5 = 17 <br>
17 + 6 = ***23*** <br>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

In the given ascending series, the difference between two consecutive numbers is in decreasing order i.e., 6, 5, 4, and 3, respectively.

Pattern: <br>
30 - 6 = 24 <br>
24 - 5 = 19 <br>
19 - 4 = 15 <br>
15 - 3 = ***12*** <br>

Answer: (c)
</div> <br>


### Type 3: Same Number is multiplied/divided 

In this type of series, the ratio between two consecutive numbers is the same. That is, we divide or multiply the previous element by the same number to get the next element in the series. 

Series which looks multiplication type in one direction, will look division type in another direction and vice-versa.

##### Q. Find the missing number in the following series: <br>
4, 12, 36, 108, ?
<pre>(a) 180        (b) 324          (c) 264          (d) 216</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

In the given ascending series, the ratio between two consecutive numbers is 3. So, it's basically a simple multiplication series, if seen from left to right. 

Pattern: <br>
4 × 3 = 12 <br>
12 × 3 = 36 <br>
36 × 3 = 108 <br>
108 × 3 = ***324*** <br>

Answer: (c)
</div> <br>


##### Q. Find the missing number in the following series: <br>
168, 84, 42, 21, ?
<pre>(a) 11        (b) 9.5          (c) 10          (d) 10.5</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

In the given descending series, the ratio between two consecutive numbers is 2. So, it's basically a simple division series, if seen from left to right. 

Pattern: <br>
168 ÷ 2 = 84 <br>
84 ÷ 2 = 42 <br>
42 ÷ 2 = 21 <br>
21 ÷ 2 = ***10.5*** <br>

18 ÷ 2 = 9 <br>
36 ÷ 4 = 9 <br>
24 ÷ 2 = ***12*** <br>

Answer: (a)
</div> <br>


### Type 4: Increasing order Multiplication / Division

In this type of series, elements are multiplied or divided with numbers in increasing/decreasing order to obtain the next element.

##### Q. Find the missing number in the following series: <br>
3, 3, 4.5, 9, 22.5, ?

36 ÷ 3 = 12 <br>
12 ÷ 2 = 6 <br>
6 ÷ 1 = 6 <br>

{{% alert note %}}
It’s easier to deal with smaller numbers. So, we may start from the right in the given series, to decipher the pattern. Also, as the missing number is right at the beginning, it makes sense to look at this series from right to left. 

If seen from right to left, then this series will be an ascending multiplication series.

Answer: (c)
</div> <br>


### Type 5: Mixed Series

In such series we see a mix of operators being used. That is, instead of just using a single addition, subtraction, multiplication or division operator throughout the series, we use a mix of them. So, obviously the difficulty level goes up. 

Let's have a look at some examples. It will make this more clear to you. 

#### Type 5a: Same multiplication, Same addition

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Next number = Previous number × 2 + 1

Pattern: <br>
(5 × 2) + 1 = 11 <br>
(11 × 2) + 1 = 23 <br>
(23 × 2) + 1 = 47 <br>
(47 × 2) + 1 = 95<br>
(95 × 2) + 1 = ***191*** <br>

{{% alert note %}}
Another way to look at it:

The differences between the elements in the series are: <br>

102, 101, 98, 93, 86, 74, 66, 53
<pre>(a) 66        (b) 74          (c) 70          (d) 54</pre>
<pre>(SSC CGL Question)</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Pattern: <br>
102 - 1 = 101 <br>
101 - 3 = 98 <br>
98 - 5 = 93 <br>
93 - 7 = 86 <br>
86 - 9 = ***77*** <br>
77 - 11 = 66 <br>
66 - 13 = 53 <br>

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>

## Number Series – Threat?

In some questions deciphering the underlying concept used may prove to be an uphill task. Hence, in exam you should adopt the following strategy, when it comes to attempting series questions (esp. in case of number series):

* Read the series and see if any pattern is evident. 

* If not then do not waste more than 1 minute in any case. Move ahead… 

* Come back in the second round of the paper and give it another shot.
