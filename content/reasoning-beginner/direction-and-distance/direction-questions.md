## Type 1: Initial Direction is given

In this type of questions, we are given:
* the initial direction of movement 
* various turns taken 

We need to find out the final direction of movement.

##### Q. A boy is going towards North-West, then he turned left 3 times and then turned right 5 times. In which direction is he going now?
<pre>(a) East   (b) South-West    (c) North   (d) South-East</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

We are only supposed to find his final direction.

He takes 3 left turns and 5 right turns. Hence, he effectively took 5R – 3L = 2R, i.e. 2 right turns. <br>
2 right turns means he rotated in clockwise direction by 180°.

So, he must now be moving in South-East direction. 

Answer: (d)
</div> <br>


##### Q. A boy is going towards North, then he turned right by 135° and then turned left 3 times. Again he turns 45° towards the right and then 225° left. In which direction is he going now?
<pre>(a) North-East   (b) West    (c) North   (d) South-East</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

We are only supposed to find his final direction.

Total right side turns = 135° + 45° = 180° <br>
Total left side turns = 270° (as he took 3 left turns) + 225° = 495° = (495° - 360°) = 135°

Hence, he effectively took 180° – 135° = 45° right turn, i.e. in clockwise direction. 

So, he must now be moving in North-East direction. 

Answer: (a)

## Type 2: Final Direction is given

In this type of questions, we are given:
* the final direction of movement 
* various turns taken 

We need to find out the initial direction of movement.

We can solve such questions in two ways. 

The first method will be to start from the final direction given, and then trace the person's movements backwards. But this may cause you to commit some errors. So, we will use a different method, that is less error-prone. 

Steps to solve such questions:

* Assume that the concerned person is walking in the North direction and trace his movements.

* Adjust the initial assumption based on the difference in the assumed final direction and the real final direction mentioned in the question.

##### Q. Bear Grylls, an adventurer, was seeking to get out of a desert. He started travelling in a particular direction and walked for 4 km. Thereafter he turned left and travelled for another 4 km. Then started walking directly towards the starting point. If his direction of movement is South-West now, then what was the direction in which he had started walking initially?
<pre>(a) South-East   (b) East    (c) North-East   (d) North</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Let's assume Bear Grylls' initial direction of movement to be North. If his starting point is A, then we can depict his path using the following diagram:
<img src="../../../media/direction/direction-question-2.png" alt="direction questions" style="width:63%;height:63%;">

So, if the initial (assumed) direction of Bear Grylls was towards the North, then his final (assumed) direction would be South-East. 

But according to the question, Bear Grylls' real final direction of movement is South-West, i.e. 90° towards the clockwise direction with respect to the assumed final direction. 

Hence, his actual initial direction must also be 90° towards the clockwise direction with respect to the assumed initial direction. So, his actual initial direction is towards the East. 

His actual movement may be depicted as below:
<img src="../../../media/direction/direction-question-3.png" alt="direction questions" style="width:63%;height:63%;">

Bear Grylls moves from A to B, then from B to C and finally back to A. Hence, if the direction CA corresponds to South – West, then direction AB must correspond to East.

Answer: (b)

## Type 3: Finding Relative Directions

In this type of questions, we are given:
* the initial direction of movement of an object/person, and then various turns taken by it, till it reaches the final destination or
* relative initial positions of two or more objects/persons, and then various turns taken by them.

We need to find out the relative directions of two or more objects/persons/locations (with respect to each other).

{{% alert note %}}
As in these questions, we are interested in finding the ***relative direction*** of an object/person/location (with respect to some other object/person/location), the distance travelled by an object/person matters. 

Distances travelled do not matter in case we need to find out ***absolute direction***.

##### Q. Chimu starts walking South from his house, walks for a mere 50 m, and then turns left and walks 25 m. He again turns left and walks 10 m, before turning right and walking 5 m to reach the school of his kids. What is the direction of his kids' school from his house?
<pre>(a) North   (b) North-East    (c) South-West   (d) South-East</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

The path taken by Chimu has been depicted in the diagram given below:
<img src="../../../media/direction/direction-question-4.png" alt="direction questions" style="width:45%;height:45%;">

It is evident from the diagram, that kids' school is in South-East direction from Chimu's house.

## Shadow-based Questions

##### Q. The shadow casted by a pole is twice its height and points eastwards. Which of the following is the probable time of the day?
<pre>(a) 8 A.M. (b) 10 A.M. (c) 1 P.M. (d) 4 P.M.</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

<img src="../../../media/direction/direction-question-1.png" alt="direction questions" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

As the shadow is eastwards, therefore the sun must be in the west. Thus, it is past afternoon, i.e., options (a) and (b) are incorrect.

Now, we know that shadows are longer during morning and evening, while they are shorter near noon time.

It's given that, length of shadow is very long as compared to the object, i.e., Sun’s angle of inclination is small as shown in diagram. <br>
At 1 P.M., sun is still high above-head and forms a greater angle of inclination, while at 4 P.M. it will form a smaller angle of inclination. 

Thus, probable time is 4 P.M.
