Coding-Decoding is process of enciphering and transmitting an information from one place to other using some suitable codes, so that it might be understood and used by the concerned person only. 

* Coding converts information into scrambled data.

* Decoding unscrambles the meaningless data (deciphering) and fetches information out of it. 	


## Different types of questions

* Coding Based on Rearrangement of Letters

* Coding Based on Replacement of Letters

* Number & Symbol Coding

* Mathematical Operations based Coding

* Coding by Word Replacement

* Fictitious Language Coding

* Conditional Coding

* Matrix Coding

* Input-Output Coding
