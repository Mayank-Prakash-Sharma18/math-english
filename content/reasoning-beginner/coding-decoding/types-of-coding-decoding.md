Let's us see all the different types of questions that we may encounter in this chapter. 

## Types of Coding-Decoding Questions

### Type 1: Coding Based on Rearrangement of Letters

In this type of coding, some or all of the letters of the original word are rearranged in a particular manner to obtain the code.

##### Q. If in a coded language 'BRINJAL' is written as 'LAJNIRB', then how will 'HEATER' be written in that code?
<pre>(a) RTEAEH  (b) RETAEH  (c) RETAHE  (d) REATEH</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

The deciphered pattern has been represented in the figures given below:

<img src="../../../media/coding-decoding/coding-decoding-2.png" alt="Coding Decoding" style="width:81%;height:81%;">

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>


### Type 2: Coding Based on Replacement of Letters

In this type of coding, the letters of the words are ***replaced*** (not just rearranged) by other letters following a certain pattern.

Broadly, you will encounter two types of Replacement Coding:

* <strong>Forward Sequence Coding</strong> - In this type of coding, every letter of the word is coded in increasing order of English alphabet.

* <strong>Backward Sequence Coding</strong> - In this type of coding, every letter of the word is coded in decreasing order of English alphabet.


##### Q. If in a certain code language 'BLACK' is written as 'CMBDL', then how will 'BROWN' be written in that code?
<pre>(a) CSPXO  (b) CSRXO  (c) ASRXO  (d) CSPVO</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

The deciphered pattern has been represented in the figures given below:

<img src="../../../media/coding-decoding/coding-decoding-3.png" alt="Coding Decoding" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

<img src="../../../media/coding-decoding/coding-decoding-4.png" alt="Coding Decoding" style="width:72%;height:72%;">

Answer: (a)
</div> <br>


### Type 3: Number and Symbol Coding

In this type of coding, numerical or symbolic code is assigned to the letters. 

##### Q. In a certain code 'COPE' is written as 9&2# and 'PRISM' is written as 2@3$*, then how will 'PIPE' be written in that code?
<pre>(a) 373@         (b) 292&          (c) &3&#          (d) 232#</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Here, every letter has been assigned a particular number/symbol. That is the code of that letter. 

We got to this conclusion, as the common letter 'P' has the same code in both the given words, i.e. 2. 

CONE: C - 9; O - &; P - 2; E - # <br>
PRISM: P - 2; R - @; I - 3; S - $; M - *

So, code of PIPE will be: 232#

Answer: (d)
</div> <br>

##### Q. If ALARM is written as 11211813, how is BIRD written in that code ?
<pre>(a) 29184         (b) 29194          (c) 18194          (d) 21822</pre>
<pre>(SSC Question)</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Here, every letter has been assigned a particular number, which is the numeric position of that letter in the English alphabet. 

<img src="../../../media/series/letters-numbered.png" alt="Letters numbered" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

ALARM: A - 1; L - 12; A - 1; R - 18; M - 13  

So, code of BIRD will be: 29184

Answer: (a)
</div> <br>

##### Q. If H = 8 and HAT = 29. Find how much BOX = ?
<pre>(a) 42         (b) 43          (c) 41          (d) 46</pre>
<pre>(SSC Question)</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Here, every letter/word has been assigned a particular number, which is the numeric sum of the alphabetic positions of all the letters in that word. 

<img src="../../../media/series/letters-numbered.png" alt="Letters numbered" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

H: Alphabetic position is 8

HAT: Sum of the alphabetic positions of all the letters = 8 (H) + 1 (A) + 20 (T) = 29

So, code of BOX will be: 2 + 15 + 24 = 41

Answer: (c)
</div> <br>


### Type 4: Mathematical Operations Based Coding

Such coding involves the use of equations and inequalities. 

##### Q. If 9 x 5 x 2 = 529 and 4 x 7 x 2 = 724, then 3 x 9 x 8 =?
<pre>(a) 938         (b) 983          (c) 839          (d) 893</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

<img src="../../../media/coding-decoding/coding-decoding-5.png" alt="Coding Decoding" style="width:45%;height:45%;">

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>

### Type 5: Coding by Word Replacement

Under this pattern, a word is coded with another word, which in turn is coded with another word and so on. 

There are two minute variations in this Question Type:

* Case I: <br>
In case of ‘***called as***’: Second word is the code for the first word. <br>
E.g. Lion is called a Dog: It means Lion is coded as Dog.

* Case II: <br>
In case of ***‘means’***: First word is the code for the second word. <br>
E.g. Lion means Dog: It means Lion is the code for Dog.

##### Q. If orange is called as apple, apple is called as grape, grape is called as mango, mango is called as strawberry, strawberry is called as guava, which of the following is a yellow fruit ?
<pre>(a) Apple         (b) Grape         (c) Strawberry          (d) Mango</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Clearly, 'mango' is the yellow fruit but 'mango' is called 'strawberry'. 

So, ' strawberry' is the code for yellow fruit.

Answer: (c)
</div> <br>

##### Q. If ‘red' means 'green', 'green' means 'white', 'white 'means' 'yellow', 'yellow' is called 'violet; then what is the colour of grass?
<pre>(a) White         (b) Red         (c) Violet          (d) Blue</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Colour of grass is 'green' but here ‘red' means 'green' and hence according to the given information colour of grass must be coded as ‘red'.

Answer: (b)
</div> <br>

<!-- Commented out for ebook sake -->
<!-- {{% alert note %}}
***Summary***

In case of ‘called as’: Second word is the code for the first word. <br>
So move forward.

In case of ‘means’: First word is the code for the second word. <br>
So move backward.

In case nothing is mentioned, e.g. ‘blue is green’, then assume it as ‘blue is called as green’ (i.e. 1st case) and solve.

### Type 6: Fictitious Language Coding

In this type of questions, group of codes (words, letters, numbers, symbols etc) is assigned to group of words. 

##### Q. In a certain code language 'she is tall' is written as 'om po jo' and 'is he dumb' is written as 'ot om do'. Find the code for 'is'.
<pre>(a) ot         (b) po         (c) om          (d) do</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

<img src="../../../media/coding-decoding/coding-decoding-6.png" alt="Coding Decoding" style="width:63%;height:63%;">

Clearly, code for 'is' = ka

{{% alert note %}}
code for 'she' and 'tall' = po or jo

code for 'he' or 'dumb' = ot or do
{{% /alert %}}

Answer: (c)
</div> <br>


### Type 7: Conditional Coding

Here, codes of letters/numbers are given right under them (generally in a two row table). Apart from this, some conditions may also be given. 

Candidates are required to find out code for a particular word/number according to the given conditions.

##### Q. Find out which of the combinations correctly represents the group of letters based on the following coding system and the conditions that follow.

<img src="../../../media/coding-decoding/coding-decoding-7.png" alt="Coding Decoding" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

Conditions: <br>
(i) If both first and last letters are vowels, their codes are to be interchanged. <br>
(ii) If the first letter is a consonant and the last letter is a vowel, both are to be coded as the code for the consonant.

Find the code for 'BHMI'.

<pre>(a) 9#$!         (b) 91!$         (c) 81$%          (d) 91!9</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

BHMI → First letter (i.e. B) is a consonant and the last letter (i.e. I) is a vowel. So, Condition (ii) will apply. 

Code of BHMI without applying any condition: 91!$

Code of BHMI without applying Condition (ii): 91!9

{{% alert note %}}
Condition (i) is of no use in this question. 
{{% /alert %}}

Answer: (d)
</div> <br>


### Type 8: Matrix Coding

In such questions, two matrices are given, each having letters/numbers. 

The columns and rows of Matrix I are numbered from 0 to 4 / (A to E) and those of Matrix II from 5 to 9 / (F to J). 

Each letter/number in these matrices can be represented by two digits:
* first digit is the row number and 
* second digit is the column number.

##### Q. Consider the following two matrices. In each matrix a letter is represented first by its row and next by its column, e.g. ‘A’ can be represented by 01, 22 etc, and M can be represented by 68, 79 etc. Similarly, you have to identify the set for the word PEARL.

<pre>(a) 00,55,22,11,96 (b) 13,77,30,14,88 (c) 12,88,43,32,89 (d) 00,66,14,32,56</pre>
<pre>(SSC Question)</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

It's better to solve such questions via options. That is, we will use <strong>Elimination Method</strong>.

Option (b): 13, 77, 30, ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">14, 88</span>*** → PEA ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">AE</span>*** (incorrect)

Option (c): ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">12</span>***, 88, 43, 32, 89 → ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">Z</span>***EARL (incorrect)

Option (d): 00, 66, 14, 32, ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">56</span>*** → PEAR ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">M</span>*** (incorrect)

Option (a): 00, 55, 22, 11, 96 → PEARL (correct)

Answer: (a)
