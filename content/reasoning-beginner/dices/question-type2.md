#### Finding out the blank face of a dice

##### Q. A dice has been given below in four positions. Which alphabet will come in place of question mark?
<img src="../../../media/dices/four-dices1.png" alt="dices" style="width:99%;height:99%;">
<pre> (a) S    (b) D    (c) S/U     (d) U </pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">
Comparing positions I and III, D is common. On applying the clockwise rule, we get:<br>
Opposite pairs: S - U; M - Y and D - W <br>
Now, if we compare positions I and IV, we can see that in both the positions M and D are visible, but in reverse orientation. So, the face that we want to find out must be the one opposite to S, i.e. U.<br>
Answer: (d) <br>
