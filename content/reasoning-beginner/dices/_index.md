## Basic Concept

Dices are cubical or cuboidal shape objects containing numbers /figures/symbols/ embedded on their six surfaces.

A dice has 6 faces, 8 corners and 12 edges.

## Types of Dices

Dice having digits/dots from 1 to 6 on its surfaces can be divided into two types:

* Standard Dice - When the sum of digits/dots on opposite faces is equal to 7, then the dice is called standard dice. <br>
That is, Sum of the opposite faces:
1 + 6 = 7, 2 + 5 = 7, 3 + 4 = 7


* General/Non-standard Dice - When the sum of digits/dots on two or all three pair of opposite faces is not equal to 7, then the dice is called general dice. <br>
In other words, a dice which is not a standard dice is called a general dice.

Note: If two pair of opposite faces have sum of 7, then the third pair of opposite faces will definitely have a sum of 7.

## Identifying a dice as standard or general dice

If we see any dice from any angle, then we can see a maximum of only three faces of it: Front surface, top surface and right/left surface. We cannot see the opposite faces.

So, how will we identify any dice as standard or general?

If sum of any two adjacent faces of dice is equal to 7, this definitely is a general dice. For example, this one:
<img src="../../../media/dices/general-dice.png" alt="dices" style="width:36%;height:36%;">

If sum of any two adjacent faces of dice is not equal to 7, this may be a standard dice or a general dice. We cannot be sure because we donâ€™t know any of the 3 pairs of opposite faces. For example, this one:
<img src="../../../media/dices/standard-or-general.png" alt="dices" style="width:36%;height:36%;">

## Types of Questions asked

* Finding Digits/Dots/Letters/Colours on the opposite face of any particular face

* Finding Digits/Dots/Figures/Symbols at the blank face

* Questions related to unfolded dice
