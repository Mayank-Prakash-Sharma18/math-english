## Basic Concept

A Cube is a three-dimensional solid object bounded by six square faces or surfaces. 
<img src="../../../media/cubes/cube.png" alt="cubes" style="width:45%;height:45%;">
A cube has 8 corners and 12 edges. <br>
In a cube, Length = Breadth = Height (in cuboid these are different)<br><br>

Every cube has six faces out of which a maximum of 3 faces are visible at a time.<br>
Every face has four adjacent faces and one opposite face. Two adjacent faces meet at a single side/edge and three faces adjacent to each other meet at a single vertex/corner.<br><br>

## Different types of questions asked:

* Cutting of a cube/cuboid
* A larger cube/cuboid is painted and cut OR vice-versa
* Counting of cubes in a block
