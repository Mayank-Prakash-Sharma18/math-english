These puzzles are one of the most challenging of the Circular Arrangement Puzzles. Let's see a few examples.

##### Q. Read the information given below and answer the 3 (three) items that follow.

6 persons P, Q, R, S, T and U are sitting along the 6 sides of a hexagon table. Three persons are facing towards the centre of the table while the rest are facing outwards. It's also given that:
1. Q is sitting opposite to P.
2. U and R are facing outwards.
3. P sits to the right of U.
4. S is sitting next to Q, towards his right-hand side.
5. The two persons sitting adjacent to P and the person sitting in front of P are facing outwards.

Q1.	Who is sitting opposite to S? <br>
(a) U	<br>
(b) R <br>
(c) T	<br>
(d) P <br>

Q2.	Who is sitting between Q and R? <br>
(a) T <br>
(b) S <br>
(c) U	<br>
(d) P <br>

Q3.	Q stands up, turns towards his right and walks along the table to Pâ€™s position. Who are the two persons that he would come across along the way? <br>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

The following diagrams depict a hexagonal table. Arrows are in the direction towards which the concerned person is facing. 

From statement 5, we already know that the two persons sitting adjacent to P and the person sitting in front of P are facing outwards. Thus, P must be facing inwards.

Now Q is sitting opposite to P (statement 1). Thus,

According to statement 2, U and R are facing outwards, thus we have two possible sitting arrangements:

According to statement 3, P sits to the right of U. Thus case I may be eliminated.

One needs to be careful while deciding which position is to the right of U, as he is facing outwards
{{% /alert %}}

Now, according to the 4th statement, S is sitting next to Q, towards his right hand side. Thus, we have:

Obviously, T will occupy the last vacant position. So the final picture that emerges can be shown as below:
