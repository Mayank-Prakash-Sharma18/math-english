In this type of arrangement, objects/persons are placed around a circle:

* either facing the centre.

* or facing the direction opposite to the centre

Now, let us understand some concepts related to Circular Arrangement. 

Consider the following circular sitting arrangement:

### Concept 1

Q. Who is sitting in front of F?

Now, let's understand this topic further with the help of an example. 

##### Q. Study the following information carefully and answer the given question. 

Four ladies A, B, C and D and four gentlemen E, F, G and H are sitting in a circle around a table facing each other.

I.	No two ladies or two gentlemen are sitting side-by-side. <br>
II.	C, who is sitting between G and E, is facing D. <br>
III.	F is between D and A and is facing G. <br>
IV.	H is to the right of B.

E is facing whom?

<pre>(a) F  (b) B  (c) G  (d) H</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

Statement III: F is between D and A and is facing G.

Two cases are feasible:

Statement II: C, who is sitting between G and E, is facing D.

<img src="../../../media/puzzles/circular-arrangement-2.png" alt="Circular arrangement" style="width:81%;height:81%;">

Statement IV: H is to the right of B.

<img src="../../../media/puzzles/circular-arrangement-3.png" alt="Circular arrangement" style="width:81%;height:81%;">

Statement I: No two ladies or two gentlemen are sitting side-by-side.

Case II can be rejected as B and D, as well as G and H are sitting together here. Case I is fine. 

<img src="../../../media/puzzles/circular-arrangement-4.png" alt="Circular arrangement" style="width:45%;height:45%;">

So, E is facing H. 

Answer: (d)
