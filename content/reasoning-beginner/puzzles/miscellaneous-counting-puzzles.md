In this article, we will have a look at some of the counting puzzles where we just need to apply our common sense, and count. 


## Type 1 

##### Read the information given below and answer the two items that follow.

Five cities are connected by 6 roads as shown in the figure below. 
<img src="../../../media/puzzles/counting-puzzles-1.png" alt="Counting Puzzles" style="width:54%;height:54%;">
Ram wants to traverse all the six roads once and only once, such that he does not end up in the same city from where he started his journey. 

Q1. Which of the following statements is/are definitely true?
1. There is no such route possible.
2.  C can be the starting as well as the ending city for Ram.

(a) 1 only <br>
(b) 2 only <br>
(c) Both 1 and 2 <br>
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Q2. If Ram starts his journey from city E, then how many such route(s) is/are possible that satisfy all the given conditions? <br>
(a) 0 <br>
(b) 1 <br>
(c) 2 <br>
(d) 3

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

**Statement 1**: First of all let us find whether such a path is possible or not. Starting from city C, we can see that every road in the route CABCDEB is traversed only once.  Also, the end city is B, which is different from the starting city A. Though, Ram visits the city he started his journey from, i.e. C, once again, but itâ€™s not his end point. So, it satisfies all the given conditions and such a route is possible. Thus, statement 1 is false.

**Statement 2**: As mentioned in the question, Ram cannot finish his journey in the same city from where he started his journey. So, statement 2 is false.

Answer: (d)

## Type 2

##### Q. A box contains 31 red and 25 blue balls. If balls are drawn one by one, what is the minimum number of balls that have to be drawn to ensure that at least one blue and one red ball are obtained? 
<pre>(a) 26   (b) 40    (c) 32   (d) 31</pre>

Explanation:<br>
<div class="Exp">

As there are 25 blue balls, it might be a possibility that the first 25 balls are all blue. Hence, to get at least one red ball, at least 26 balls need to be drawn. 

Similarly, as there are 31 red balls, it might be a possibility that the first 31 balls are red. Hence, to get at least one blue ball, at least 32 balls need to be drawn.

Hence, the minimum number of balls that have to be drawn to ensure that at least one blue and one red ball are obtained = 32.

Answer: (c)
